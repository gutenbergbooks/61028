<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>STRANGERS COME TO MARSHFIELDEN</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>An English summer! The birds sang merrily, and the
trees bowed their heads, keeping time with the melody.
The breeze whispered its accompaniment, and all the
glades and woods were happy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Marshfielden was, perhaps, one of the prettiest
villages in Derbyshire. Nestling among the peaks of
that lovely county, its surroundings were most picturesque.
Its straggling street, for it had but one, was
unspoiled by tripper or tourist, for its charms were
unknown to the outside world. The road was cobbled,
and boasted of no pavement, and long gardens, shining
with marigolds and nasturtiums, reached down to each
side of it, forming frames to the pretty, irregular
little cottages with their gables and latticed windows.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little church at the top of the street finished the
picture. It was very tiny, holding only about one
hundred and fifty people; but with its ivy-covered
towers, and picturesque little graveyard, the vicar was
a lucky man to have charge of such a place. Unmarried
and friendless he had come to Marshfielden forty years
before, and had lodged with Mrs. Skeet, the cobbler’s
wife. Still he remained, having grown old in the
service of his people.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a well-known fact, that “our vicar” as Mr.
Winthrop was called, had during all that time never
left the precincts of the parish. Children had grown
up and gone away married; old people had died; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>still Mr. Winthrop went on in his kind, fatherly
manner, advising those who sought the benefit of his
wisdom, helping those who needed his aid, and still
living in the little rooms he had rented when first he
came to Marshfielden, a stranger.</p>

<p class='c012'>Marshfielden was about seven miles off the main road.
As they would have to reach it by narrow lanes and
rutted roads, motorists never came its way, and it
retained its old-world simplicity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two miles to the south was a coal mine, in which
most of the villagers toiled. It was quite an
unimportant one, and not very deep, but it gave
employment to all the natives who needed work.
Strange as it seems, however, by an unwritten law,
not one of the villagers entered Marshfielden in his
collier dirt or collier garb. Every one of the men
changed his clothes at “Grimland” as the mine
district was called, and washed away the coal dust
and dirt; so in the evening, when they made their way
in a body to their homes, they returned as fresh and
clean as they had left them in the morning.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, therefore, an ideal place to live in and as
old Mr. Winthrop walked down the uneven street, his
eyes dimmed and his thoughts were tender as he
acknowledged first one, then another of his flock.</p>

<p class='c012'>He stopped at the gate of a pretty, white cottage
with a well kept garden full of sweet-smelling flowers,
and greeted the woman who stood at the gate.</p>

<p class='c012'>She was quite young and pretty, and maternal love
and pride glowed in her face as she gently crooned
over the sleeping babe at her breast.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And how’s Jimmy, Mrs. Slater?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well indeed, sir, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you—how are you feeling?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite all right again, now, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s right. And your husband?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir, he’s had a rise at the mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Winthrop smiled and was about to pass on,
when he noticed an underlying current of excitement
in the woman’s manner. He looked at her curiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the matter, Mrs. Slater?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you heard the news, sir?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“No. What news?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I be agoin’ to have lodgers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well I heard only last night, sir. Bill—he came
home and said as ’ow Mr. Dickson, the manager at
the mine, had heard from Sir John Forsyth—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The new owner of Grimland?” queried Mr.
Winthrop.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir. Well, he said as ’ow Sir John wanted
both his nephews to go to the mine and learn the
practical working of it—and Mr. Dickson was to find
them rooms near by.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Mr. Dickson knows as ’ow my ’ome is
clean—” and Mrs. Slater looked around her little
cottage with an air of pride.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And ’e asks Bill if I would take them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so you are going to?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman looked round her fearfully. “I’ve a
spare bedroom, sir, which I’ve cleaned up, and they
can have my parlour. But fancy, sir, two strangers in
Marshfielden!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It will liven things up,” remarked the vicar
“we’ve never had strangers to live here since I came—now
over forty years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sir, nor before that,” went on the woman in
a low tone. “My grandmother used to speak of two
ladies who came to Marshfielden when she was a little
girl. Artists they were, and strangers. The clergyman’s
wife put them up—and—and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes?” urged Mr. Winthrop gently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, sir, they were both found dead one day, stiff
and cold, sir, outside the ruins of the Priory. They
had been painting, and their easels were left standing—but
they were dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What has that to do with the case?” asked the
vicar with a little smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you see, sir,” she went on quickly, the
same half-scared look coming into her eyes, “that
was the ‘Curse’ that caused those mishaps, and I
am afraid the ‘Curse’ will be on the two young
gentlemen, too.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Nonsense,” laughed Mr. Winthrop, “You don’t
really believe that the ‘Marshfielden Curse’ as you
people call it, had anything to do with the deaths of
those two lady artists that occurred over fifty years
ago?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed I do, sir,” averred the woman. “Why ever
since the Priory was dismantled by Henry the Eighth,
the ‘Curse’ has been on this place. That wasn’t the
only case, sir. There are records of many others—but
that was the last.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me see,” began the vicar, “It’s so long since
I even heard it mentioned, that I’ve forgotten what
it was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman’s face contracted as if she was afraid of
something, she knew not what, but of something
mystic, intangible, uncanny—and she repeated slowly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>When the eighth Henry fair Marshfielden’s monastery took,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Its priory as a palace, its vast income to his privy purse,—</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The outcast prior solemnly, by candle, bell and book</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Upon this place for ever laid this interdict and curse</i>:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><i>From now until the end of time,</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Whene’er a stranger come</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Unto Marshfielden’s pleasaunces,</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>To make therein his home,</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Troubles—disease—misfortunes—death—</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>Upon the spot shall fall.</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>So—an’ Marshfielden folks ye’d swell</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>With fair prosperity, and safely dwell,</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>All strangers from your gates expel,</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'><i>And live cut off from all.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The vicar laughed. “Yes, it’s a pretty legend, Mrs.
Slater, but remember this is the twentieth century,
and nothing is likely to happen to Marshfielden, its
inhabitants or its visitors, because of that. Why, I
was a stranger when I came, yet nothing very terrible
has happened to me during these last forty years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, sir, you don’t count. I mean, sir, you belong
to the Priory; you are our priest. You wouldn’t come
under the ‘Curse’ sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And neither will any one else, Mrs. Slater. It’s
a stupid legend.—Have no fear.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“But,” began Mrs. Slater. “How do you account
for the case of—” But Mr. Winthrop lifted up a
deprecatory hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot listen to any more, Mrs. Slater.” And
a note of authority came into his voice. “Why, all
this is against the religion I preach to you—never listen
to tales of superstition. Have no fear, do the best
you can for the two young gentlemen, and I think I
can promise you that no harm will come to them or
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman shook her head, and disbelief shone in
her eyes. The vicar saw it, and smiled again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well! It remains to be proved that I am
right,” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It remains to be proved, <i>which</i> of us is right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well, we’ll leave it at that. When do they
arrive?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“About six this evening, sir; the usual time when
the men come home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will call in this evening then, and welcome them.
Good-bye, Mrs. Slater, and don’t go listening to or
spreading idle gossip!” And the kindly old man went
away down the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>That evening, when the bell rang to denote the
return of the men-folk, every door was occupied by
an eager face, anxious not only to catch sight of the
two strangers, but also to take another look at the
woman who had dared to defy the “Marshfielden
Curse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For in this little village the “Curse” was a real,
poignant fact, and was spoken of in the twilight with
hushed tones and furtive glances. Children were
quieted and terrified by it, and the fear imbibed by
them in their childhood grew with them till their
death. Not one of them but Mary Slater would have
risked its anger by allowing a stranger to sleep
beneath her roof; and even Mary, although outwardly
calm, was inwardly terrified lest her action might be
the means of bringing disaster and misery, not only
on her two lodgers, but on the whole little community.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dan Murlock, the husband of the little woman at the
corner house, was the first to arrive. He came along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>at a swinging pace, and waved his cap jauntily as he
saw his wife’s trim little figure at the doorway.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hullo, Moll,” he cried, when he was within
speaking distance “an’ how’s yersel’?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m all right,” she replied, while their three year
old, curly haired boy and only child peeped from behind
his mother’s skirts and cried “Boo” to his dad.
The man looked at them both, with awe as well as
pride in his glance. Even now he was often heard to
remark, that he could not make out why a clumsy
brute like him should be allowed to own such an
angelic wife and child.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where’s the strangers?” asked Moll eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Comin’ along, lass. Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, the ‘Curse,’ Dan!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind the ‘Curse,’ lass; that’s done with
long ago! Is supper ready yet?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Dan. It’s ready.” But his wife made no
effort to re-enter their little home, and serve the meal
her husband wanted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Woman, what are you staring at?” he cried.
“Why do’ant ’ee come in? I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In a moment, Dan. I—I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s thee lookin’ at, lass?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The strangers, Dan. Think the ‘Curse’—” But
Dan only laughed good-humouredly. “Thou’rt a
fule, lass. Come in and do’ant bother yer head about
it,” and he good-naturedly put his arm through hers,
and dragged the unwilling woman into the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>Most of the women outside, however, were still
waiting, waiting for the strangers. Then suddenly
came a buzz of excitement as the news was passed
from mouth to mouth. “They’re coming! They’re
coming!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The two young men, Alan and Desmond Forsyth,
were entirely unconscious of all the attention and
interest showered on them. Of the “Curse” they
knew nothing, and had they done so, would have
cared less.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were cousins, and on very affectionate and
intimate terms, and one day would share equally in the
Grimland Colliery, of which their uncle was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>owner. Alan, moreover, would succeed to his uncle’s
title. The future looked very rosy for these two
young men.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John was determined that when they left
Cambridge, they should thoroughly learn the workings
of the mine. The instructions he gave Dickson, his
manager, were that he was to “make them work like
ordinary colliers until they were competent to take
charge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They had travelled on the Continent for six months
after coming down from the ’Varsity, and this was
their first day of real, hard work. It had left them
both eager to begin another day, for they were anxious
to learn more of the wonderful workings of the mine
below the surface of the earth. They had walked
cheerily toward Marshfielden, eager to reach their
apartments and have a good meal. They liked Slater,
and felt that they would be comfortable and happy
in his home.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you feel, young gentlemen?” he asked
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m dead tired,” answered Alan, the elder, a man
of some twenty-five years, while his cousin, Desmond,
a year younger, yawned lustily, as he asked, “How
much further is that adorable little home of yours,
Slater?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’re nigh there, sir. There’s my Mary at the
gate.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, the little cottage at the bend?” asked
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir. She’s a good lass, is my missus. She’ll
treat you well, and make you comfortable and happy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The rest of the short way was trodden in silence, and
at length the two young men stepped across the
threshold of Sweet William Cottage, as the Slaters’
home was called.</p>

<p class='c012'>The room they were ushered into was old-world
and sweet. The lattice windows were open wide,
letting in the soft, fresh air of summer. The ceiling
was low and beamed, and the furniture was of old
dark oak; while the bright chintz hangings took away
all hint of sombreness. The table was laid, and within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>a few minutes of their arrival they were sitting down
to an appetizing repast.</p>

<p class='c012'>Neither of them spoke for some time, and then
Desmond laid down his knife and fork with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m done” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should just think you were” laughed his cousin
“You’ve been stuffing incessantly for over half an
hour” Alan rang the bell for the table to be cleared
and then they lit their pipes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you feel?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very tired—very sore—and very bruised”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So am I. I think I shall like the life of a miner,
though”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rather! What a ripping set of chaps they are!”</p>

<p class='c012'>So they chattered on until it was time for them to
retire. At peace with each other, at peace with the
world, they slept until a knock at their bedroom door
awakened them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes” sleepily answered Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s four o’clock, young gentlemen, you’d better
get up”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan woke up lazily to hear Desmond cry out in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely not yet, Slater?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir. You must be at the mine by five fifteen.
Early shift to-day, you know”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, Slater” cried Alan, who was now wide
awake “we’ll be down in twenty minutes”</p>

<p class='c012'>In a very short space of time they had had their
breakfast, and were walking across the Grimland fields
to the mine, to begin once more a day’s arduous duty.</p>

<p class='c012'>It passed quickly enough, but they were thankful
when the bell sounded for them to knock off work,
and they were taken up to daylight again by the cage.</p>

<p class='c012'>When they reached Sweet William Cottage, they
found Mr. Winthrop awaiting them, with profuse
apologies for his absence the night before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m afraid Mrs. Slater omitted to give us any
message from you” said Alan “In fact we didn’t
even know you had called”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am the vicar of Marshfielden” said the kindly
old man “and I should have liked to give you a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>personal welcome. You see the ‘Curse’ has made
your position here somewhat strained”</p>

<p class='c012'>The two boys stared at each other in perplexity.
The vicar laughed. “None of the women have been
frightening you with their child’s stories yet?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No!” said both boys together, “what is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, there’s a legend connected with this place,
that any strangers in Marshfielden will bring disaster
on themselves and perhaps on the place, if they take
up their abode here”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A curse was laid on the place by a monk in Henry
the Eighth’s time, when the Priory here was
dismantled”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, is that all?” said Alan lightly “We are not
afraid of old wives’ tales like that!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Molly Murlock, who was in the kitchen with
Mary Slater, heard the words, and her brow clouded.
Drawing her child closer, she muttered as she said
good night to Mary—</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Curse’ or no ‘Curse,’ I’d rather be dead, than
live to see strangers come here”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE CURSE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The two men had now been working for three months
at the mine, and the villagers had become used to the
sight of strangers in Marshfielden. Indeed, as the
weeks sped by, and nothing uncanny happened, they
began gradually to forget the “Curse” in connection
with the two young Forsyths.</p>

<p class='c012'>Summer was now waning. Leaves were beginning
to fall and folks were making preparations for a hard
winter. Mr. Winthrop was still going round on his
kindly errands and had become sincerely attached to
the two youths who had taken up their residence so
near him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed, there was no one else in the village to whom
they could go for social intercourse, and nearly every
evening Mrs. Skeet’s little parlour was full of the smoke
and chatter of the vicar and his two young friends. It
was now the first Tuesday in October, and the evenings
were growing chilly. Mrs. Skeet had lighted a nice
fire, and they all sat round it enjoying the warmth of
its glow.</p>

<p class='c012'>People outside, passing by, heard the sound of merry
laughter, and Mr. Winthrop’s characteristic chuckle,
and smiled with him. But Moll Murlock passed the
cottage hurriedly and drew her shawl closer round
her shoulders, while a slight moan came from between
her tightly compressed lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of all the inhabitants of Marshfielden, there was one
still who had <i>not</i> forgotten the “Curse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, boys,” said Mr. Winthrop, “I suppose you
feel used to your life among us now?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Yes,” answered Alan. “It seems almost like
home to us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ve never had a proper home,” broke in
Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ours is rather a romantic story,” said Alan. “Our
mothers were twin sisters—they married on the same
day and went to the same place for their honeymoon.
A year later my mother died in giving me birth, and
Desmond’s mother died when he was only a few
months old, so we were both left babies to get on the
best way we could without a woman’s care.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor lads! Poor lads!” sighed the vicar.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When I was five my father died,” said Desmond,
“and four years later Alan’s father was drowned.
Uncle John then took us to live with him—but as he
was a bachelor we were brought up in the care of
nurses and tutors, and had no real home life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are fond of your uncle?” queried the vicar.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rather!” answered Alan. “Uncle John is the
dearest old boy imaginable. He’s a bit of a crank
though. He has been working for years on what he
calls his ‘Petradtheolin’ airship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“His what?” laughed Mr. Winthrop.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His ‘Petradtheolin’ airship. It’s his own invention,
you know, but up to now he has been unsuccessful.
He has built a wonderful aluminium airship—most
beautifully fitted and upholstered—in fact it is absolutely
ready to fly, but up to now it won’t budge an inch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is under the impression,” went on Alan “that
in the near future flying will be an every day occurrence,
and it is his greatest ambition to own the most comfortable,
most speedy, and lightest airship of the day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Winthrop smiled. “There is a great deal of
talk about flying now,” said he, “but do you honestly
think it will ever come to anything?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know,” said Alan thoughtfully, “we have
conquered the sea—‘Iron on the water shall float, like
any wooden boat’,” he quoted. “We have built ships
that can submerge and remain under water and
navigate for certain periods of time. I see no reason
why the modern man should not also conquer the air.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Mr. Winthrop shook his head. “I may be old-fashioned,
but it seems impossible to believe that
navigable ships could be built for flying, that were <i>safe</i>.
I don’t doubt that airships will be built that up to a
certain point will be successful—say for a few hours’
flight, but it seems inconceivable to me that man could
so conquer the air, that commerce and travel would
benefit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, Uncle John thinks he will conquer it with
his ‘Argenta’,” went on Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely that was not what you called it just now?”
asked the vicar.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan laughed. “The ‘Argenta’ is the name of the
ship itself, but ‘Petradtheolin’ is the name of the power
he is experimenting on, that he is desirous of using
to propel it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The machine itself is complete,” went on Desmond
enthusiastically, “the balance is perfect, and its engines
are supposed to be of wonderful velocity, but no known
power will raise it even an inch from the ground. So
he is still experimenting on this spirit. It is a formula
which embraces petrol, radium and theolin; these
chemicals are blended in some way or other—concentrated
and solidified. The engines are made so as
to generate electricity in the bonnet part. The current
acts on the solidified cubes, which as they melt are
sent through metal retorts drop by drop, and then
being conveyed to the engines should make the
machine fly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know it all sounds very fantastic, but my uncle
firmly believes in the ultimate success of his experiments.
His ambition is to be able to fly for about
one hundred hours with about a cupful of this powerful
matter. He expects each drop of the vaporized spirit,
as it issues from the retort, to keep the engines going
about fifty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It all sounds very interesting,” said Mr. Winthrop
“but is extremely puzzling. I am afraid I would
rather trust myself to Mother Earth than to your
uncle’s very ingenious ‘Argenta’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So would I,” laughed Desmond. “But the dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>old boy is so keen on his work, we don’t like to
discourage him”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And” finished Alan “there in a most wonderful
shed, rests the ‘Argenta’; its body of glistening
aluminium—its interior richly upholstered and wonderfully
arranged from engine room to kitchen, but
absolutely lifeless. And there I expect it will remain,
for he will never destroy it. It is his biggest hobby
after us—sometimes I think it even comes before us.
He has the money, he has the brains, he may perfect
this power, and if he does, he will have conferred a
great benefit upon humanity”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You stayed with him until you came here,
I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes” answered Alan “We went to Eton—Cambridge—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cambridge?” Mr. Winthrop’s face lighted up
“Dear me! Dear me! What College, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Queens” said Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Queens? That was my College”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed” cried the two boys together.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I’ve not been there for over forty-five years.
I expect the dear old place has changed a great deal?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. We had rooms opposite each other on the
same staircase in the New Buildings” said Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was since my time” said Mr. Winthrop
rather sadly “I’ve never even seen the New Buildings.
I was in the Walnut-Tree Court” Then he
stopped, and gazed into the fire, his eyes sparkling
and a colour coming into his old, worn cheeks, as
he thought of the days of his youth. Reminiscences
came quickly. “Do you remember this?” “I
remember when so-and-so happened” So the conversation
went on until they were rudely interrupted
by a sharp knock on the door, startling in its
unexpectedness. All three rose hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come in” cried the vicar and Mrs. Skeet appeared
breathing heavily, with a look of horror in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whatever is the matter?” asked Mr. Winthrop in
dismay, startled out of his usual placidity by her
frightened mien.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dan—Dan Murlock’s baby—it’s gone, sir”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Gone? Gone where?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No one knows, sir. He was playing in the garden,
safe and sound, only five minutes before, and when
Moll went to call him in to put him to bed, he had
vanished.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s impossible for the child to have gone far,”
said the vicar. “Why, he is only a baby!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Three last month, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Has any one looked for him? What have they
done?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The child can’t be spirited away,” said Alan.
“Why, there’s no traffic in the village that could
possibly hurt him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Skeet looked scared. “If you please, sir,”
she half whispered, “the people do say, as ’ow it’s
the ‘Curse’ and that he has been spirited away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The vicar blinked his eyes. “Nonsense, Mrs. Skeet!
I’m ashamed of you. Never let me hear such words
from you again. Spirited away indeed! I expect he
has strayed away into the woods at the back of the
Murlocks’ cottage. Come, lads, we’ll go down and
see Dan and his wife, and do our best to help them.”
Taking up their hats the three made their way down
the street, usually so quiet and still, but now buzzing
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they reached the Murlocks’ cottage, they saw
the front door was open wide, leaving the kitchen and
garden beyond exposed to view. Curious neighbours,
sympathetic friends, open-mouthed children were
surrounding the stricken mother, who was rocking
herself to and fro in her abandonment and grief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let us go through,” said the vicar, and the two
boys followed him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman heard the approaching footsteps, and
lifted up her tear-stained face to the intruders. She
held out her hands pathetically to the vicar, and the
tears rolled down her cheeks unchecked. He took
hold of the toil-worn hands, and was about to speak
when she caught sight of the two boys behind him. Her
eyes dilated and her body stiffened. Suddenly she
uttered a piercing scream, and pointing a shaking hand
at them, “Go, go!” she cried. “You came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Marshfielden unbidden—you defied the ‘Curse’—now
you have taken my baby—my darling, darling baby!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dan put his arm about her tenderly. “Do’ant ’ee
tak’ on so, lass,” said he gently. “Sure, we’ll find the
babby. Already John Skinner and Matt Harding have
gone with search parties to find the wee lad. We’ll
get him back, wife mine.” But she only looked
fiercely at the strangers. “Go—go—the ‘Curse’ is
on us all!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Winthrop silently motioned to the two lads and
they quickly left the stricken house, and made their
way back to their rooms in silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning on their way to work, they missed
Dan Murlock. Some of the miners eyed them
suspiciously as they asked where he was, and Slater,
their landlord, was the only one to satisfy their curiosity.
“With his wife,” said he curtly. “The wee laddie has
not been found.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wherever can he be?” said Desmond in bewilderment.
Slater shook his head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Search parties were out all night, but could find
no trace or tidings of him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you any idea what has happened?” asked
Alan. Slater gave a quick look at each in turn, and
then muttered something unintelligible under his breath,
and the boys had to be content with that.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a terrible day at the mine for the two boys;
they had to partake of their midday meal in silence, for
not one of the colliers addressed a word to them if he
could possibly avoid it. They were regarded with
suspicion mingled with fear, and the “Curse” seemed
to be on every one’s lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two days passed—a week, a fortnight; still Dan
Murlock’s baby was not found, and at last the broken-hearted
parents appeared at church in mourning, thus
acknowledging to the world that they had given up all
hope of ever seeing their little one again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Murlock was silent about it all, but every one who
knew him realized that he was a changed man. He had
idolized his wife and child, and at one blow had lost
both, for his baby was without doubt dead; and his wife
had turned from him in the throes of her grief.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The weeks passed on, Christmas was nigh upon them,
and the child was spoken of in hushed tones as one
speaks of the dead. The two boys were treated as
aliens by the men, and they were beginning to chafe
under their treatment. Although nothing had been
said openly, they knew instinctively that they were
blamed by the superstitious inhabitants for the disappearance
of the baby.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alan,” said Desmond one day, as they were sitting
apart from the rest eating their dinner, “I can’t stand
this. I am going to speak to the men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Stand what?” asked Alan wearily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why the whispers and sneers that are showered on
us whenever we are near them. They all shrink away
from us—treat us as if we were lepers; even Slater
avoids us, and the ‘Curse’ is whispered from lip to lip
as we pass.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll do no good, Desmond.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We had nothing to do with the child’s going away,
yet they treat us as if we had murdered him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Leave it alone,” said Alan, “I don’t know what
it is, but this place seems uncanny. I think I am
almost beginning to believe in the ‘Curse’ myself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond made no reply, but squaring his shoulders,
began to walk toward the miners.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look here, you fellows,” he began. “What’s
wrong with you all? Why are you treating my cousin
and me as if we were murderers? We aren’t responsible
for Murlock’s little child vanishing away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The miners moved restlessly and muttered together,
each waiting for a spokesman to assert himself, who
would teach them the line of action they should take.
Desmond continued, “You talk about the ‘Curse’!
We knew nothing about it when we came here, and to
us it seems ridiculous to imagine there is anything
supernatural about the whole affair. The river is only
a quarter of a mile from their garden gate; I know it
has been dragged, but after all it is full of whirlpools
and weeds, and if the little chap did fall into it, ten to
one his little body will never be found.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly a leader was found among the men, and
Matt Harding stood up.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Look ’ere mates,” said he. “We do’ant suppose
these young gentlemen actually hurt Dan Murlock’s
baby, or that they know where he went to, but after
all, the ‘Curse’ tells us <i>not</i> to have strangers in
Marshfielden, or evil will befall. It may befall <i>them</i>,
it may befall <i>us</i>, but some one will reap ill. Now it’s
really Slater’s fault for giving them lodgings. Let
Slater turn them out, and that may break the ‘Curse.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, aye!” cried the men in unison.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Slater?” asked one burly fellow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“With the shift above,” came the reply in another
voice. Then came groans from the rest. “Turn them
out! Turn them out!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no need to turn us out,” said Alan with
quiet dignity. “We will find rooms outside Marshfielden,
and leave at the end of the week.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Leave now! Leave now!” cried a hoarse voice,
which they recognized as belonging to Toby Skinner.</p>

<p class='c012'>That was the one word needed to make the miners
obstreperous. “Yes, go now, go now,” they cried.
“By the end of the week all our babes may be gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In vain the signal was given for the men to resume
work; but they were free of their pent up feelings, and
refused to listen to the strident tones of the bell that
called them back to their duties.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly the manager’s voice was heard above the
din and babel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Get to your work at once,” he thundered, “or take
my word for it, there will be a general lockout to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gradually the men quieted, relieved of the strain of
the past few weeks, and slunk back to work.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the trouble?” asked Mr. Dickson, coming
to the boys.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They think we are the cause of the disappearance
of Dan Murlock’s baby,” explained Alan to the
manager with some bitterness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” continued Desmond, “and now they demand
that we leave Marshfielden. That damned ‘Curse’ is
driving us mad. These people are like a set of uncivilized
savages, who believe in witchcraft and omens of
the twelfth century.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Mr. Dickson smiled as he answered them. “Our
Marshfielden folk are unique. They are almost a race
in themselves. As Cornishmen consider themselves
‘Cornish’ and not ‘English’ so Marshfielden men call
themselves ‘Marshfieldens.’ It is true they are very
superstitious for they believe implicitly in the folk
lore that has been handed down to them from all
time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What would you advise us to do?” asked Alan
somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Dickson thought a moment, and then said quickly,
“The widow of one of our men lives in a little cottage
not a quarter of a mile from here; it stands on Corlot
ground—not Marshfielden. She has a hard struggle
to make both ends meet. I will send round at once and
see if she is willing to take you two as lodgers. If she
will—then go to her, for she is clean, respectable, and
will look after you well. Meanwhile, neither of you
has had a day off yet, so go and arrange about your
luggage, and I’ll see you are fixed up somewhere with
rooms.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks,” said Alan. “I shall be very sorry to
leave Marshfielden though. It is such a quaint, old-world
place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Far too old-world for strangers,” said Mr. Dickson
significantly. The little village street was buzzing with
excitement when they reached Marshfielden. Women
were rushing to and fro across the cobbled stones,
and the whole place showed signs of some great
disturbance.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the boys approached, a sudden hush seemed to
pervade the place, and the women huddled together and
whispered “The ‘Curse’! The ‘Curse’!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll see to the
things,” said he. “You go along to Mr. Winthrop,
and tell him of the change in our plans.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right, old boy,” and Desmond went towards Mr.
Winthrop’s rooms, whistling and doing his best to
ignore the hostile looks that were directed at him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan went into the little room that had become so
dear to them both. The cottage was deserted, Mrs.
Slater was absent, and as he made his way up to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>little bedroom, he sighed as he thought of leaving the
dear little place.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a very short space of time the drawers were
emptied and the trunks packed; everything was done
except the putting together of the hundred and one
odds and ends that invariably remain about.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s good!” said he to himself, as he rose from
his knees, having finished strapping up the trunks, and
he surveyed his handiwork with pride, as he realized
the short time it had taken him to complete it all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alan!”—He turned round suddenly—it was
Desmond’s voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Coming, old chap,” but Desmond was in the room,
with a white, set face, trembling limbs and a look of
horror in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good God! Whatever is the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“John Meal—Matt Harding—” gasped Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have found Dan’s boy?” eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. Their children have disappeared too!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s true! Mr. Winthrop told me. That’s what
caused the commotion when we arrived here this
morning. This news had only just become known.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan seemed struck dumb. He looked at Desmond
with unseeing eyes; his tongue swelled, and his mouth
grew parched, but his lips would not form words.
Then suddenly sounds came. “I wonder—is it the
‘Curse’ after all?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wondered that too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When were they missed?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The children were all in school safe and sound.
Lunch time came and they were seen to enter the playground
with the other little ones. Ten minutes later
the bell was rung for them all to reassemble.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When the children did so, it was found that there
were five children missing. Harding’s three little girls
and Meal’s two had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Head Mistress was furious, thinking they had
all gone off together, and were playing truant. She
sent a message round to the parents, so John Meal
left his work in the fields, and insisted on a search
being made. He swore it was the ‘Curse’ and that if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>he found his children he would find them in company
with Harding’s, and Dan’s boy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think it is a band of gypsies at work?”
suggested Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There have been no gypsies near Marshfielden
for over five years, they say. Besides that, the extraordinary
thing is, the children disappeared from the
playground.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is a ten foot wall all round it, so it is
impossible for them to have climbed over. The only
way out is past the Head Mistress’ desk. She was
sitting there the whole of the break, and declares that
for the whole ten minutes of the luncheon time, the hall
was entirely deserted and no one passed her. It seems
impossible for them to have left the playground that
way, and equally impossible by the front entrance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why it sounds like witchcraft,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>A voice startled them. It was Mrs. Slater; her
eyes red from weeping. “I beg of you two young
gentlemen to go,” she sobbed. “The ‘Curse’ is upon
us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are going,” said Alan gently, “but we will
do our utmost to discover the children. Now let us
have our account.” But the woman threw out her
hands before her with a cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No-No-Not a penny, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, come, Mrs. Slater, don’t be foolish. Let us
have our bill,” urged Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Mrs. Slater was obdurate. “It’s only two days
you owe me, sir, and I wouldn’t touch a penny. You
are quite welcome to what you’ve had, only go—go!”
It was useless to argue and they left the house with
heavy hearts, and went toward the blacksmith’s in
order to ask some one to take their luggage away for
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good morning, Jim,” said Alan pleasantly as they
reached the forge. The man looked up and greeted
them carefully, and as he saw Alan about to step across
the threshold he gave a cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do’ant ’ee put your foot inside, gentlemen,
do’ant ’ee please! Oh, the ‘Curse’ be upon us all!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The boys shrugged their shoulders helplessly, and
Alan spoke quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Send your boy up to Mrs. Slater’s, will you, Jim?
We want our luggage taken from there to Mrs.
Warren’s cottage at Corlot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You be agoin’ away?” asked the man eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I be mighty glad, sirs. I do’ant mean to be rude,
sirs, of course we shall miss you sorely, but the ‘Curse’
has hit us sore hard since you came.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you’ll send your boy, Jim?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jim scratched his head. “Couldn’t you manage it
yourselves?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely it won’t harm you to help us out of
Marshfielden?” said Alan bitterly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do’ant rightly know, sir, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d rather lend you my trolley, sir, than my boy.
I do be mighty feared of the ‘Curse’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, Jim, give us the trolley. We’ll do it
ourselves.” The blacksmith wheeled it out, and gave
it with half an apology to Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t apologize, Jim. I understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But the blacksmith had one more thing to say.
“Do’ant ’ee trouble to bring it back to Marshfielden,
sirs, leave it with Ezra Meakin. He’ll bring it back
for ’ee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, don’t fear, Jim, we won’t return to Marshfielden
once we’ve left. Ezra shall return it safely.
We’ll pay you now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jim was not too frightened to refuse payment, and
the liberal amount of silver they showered on him
touched him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do’ant mean to be rude, sir,” he began—but the
boys had started on their way and were already wheeling
the lumbering trolley down the uneven street.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jim went back into his forge with a shaking hand.
Had he helped the “Curse” by lending his trolley—doubly
so, indeed, by accepting payment? And as he
beat the hammer on the anvil, sparks flew out all
around him like little red devils thirsting for prey!</p>

<p class='c012'>When the miners came home that night they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>unaware of the double tragedy that had come into their
midst. The strangers were gone! They rejoiced, and
Matt Harding was among the merriest. Mr. Winthrop
and John Meal were away still searching for the missing
ones, and no one had dared go to the mine to tell
Matt of his loss.</p>

<p class='c012'>He received the news with a set face, and strong
self control. No word of comfort was given him by
his comrades; he needed none. Blindly he staggered
home, his loving, grief-stricken wife comforting and
consoling him, bearing up herself in order to help the
man she loved.</p>

<p class='c012'>Silently the miners prepared for another fruitless
search.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The two young gentlemen are going to help,”
volunteered a woman in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We do’ant want no help,” cried a man baring his
brawny arm. “We’ll find the chillun ourselves.” But
the search proved futile, as they almost expected, for
as Murlock’s boy had vanished completely, so had
these other five children. But still stranger things
were happening!</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Skeet possessed a dun cow of which she was
very proud. Two days after the disappearance of the
children, she tied it up in its stall in the byre, as it was
suffering from an inflamed heel. Next morning when
she entered the byre the cow had gone, and the whole
of the thatched roof had been burnt away. Rushing
into the cottage she called Mr. Winthrop, but there was
no reply. She knocked at his bedroom door. The room
sounded empty. Again she knocked, and fear made
her open it. In a second she was out, and shrieking
in her terror, for the window was open wide, and the
vicar too had disappeared.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE LIGHT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The London papers were burning with excitement.
Marshfielden had at last become known to the vast,
outside world, for the disappearance of so many of its
inhabitants could no longer be hidden under a veil.
After the vicar was found to be missing, Mr. Dickson
at the mine made Slater promise to report the matter
to the Kiltown police—the nearest constabulary to
Marshfielden.</p>

<p class='c012'>The detective officer and his men came over and
pompously took notes and asked voluminous questions,
but after a fortnight’s search came no nearer solving
the mystery. Then one of the constables disappeared
too, and Sergeant Alken thought it was high time to
report the matter to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class='c012'>Detective Inspector Vardon, the shrewdest, cleverest
man at the Yard, came down immediately, and at once
sent for Alan and Desmond Forsyth. He had been
working out a theory coming down in the train and
these two young men were very closely connected
with it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But after his first interview with them, he realized
that his suspicions were entirely wrong, and knew he
must look elsewhere for a clue. Alan told the full story
without any hesitation whatsoever and explained how
they themselves had suffered over the “Curse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pooh Pooh!” laughed Vardon “We will leave
the ‘Curse’ out of the question. These mysteries are
caused by no witchcraft, but by a clever, cunning
brain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you really think so?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” and Alan gave a sigh of relief as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>murmured, “you don’t know how that has relieved
me. I was beginning to get quite a horror of the
unknown.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course it’s an uncanny case,” went on the
Inspector, “but we’ll solve the problem yet.” Then
he added laughingly, “I came down here prepared to
suspect you two young gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Us? Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, all these mysteries occurred after you arrived
here, and I found you were none too popular with the
natives.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond was indignant, but Vardon soon cooled him
down. “See here, my dear sir. It’s my business to
suspect everybody until I convince myself of his innocence.
I know now I was mistaken—therefore I have
been candid with you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The inquiries lasted some time, and every day
brought some fresh disaster in its wake, filling the
little village with misery and consternation, and the
London editors’ pockets with gold. Sightseers and
tourists came galore to the stricken place, and the
carrier between Marshfielden and Kiltown reaped a
small fortune from the curious. Every day the papers
recounted some fresh loss—perhaps a cow or a pig, but
often a human life. Women kept inside their homes,
and even the men folk walked about in pairs, so that
they could help each other should the “unknown” fall
upon them.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two boys still worked in the mine, and the men,
realizing at last that they were not the instigators of
all the trouble, admitted them, charily enough at first,
into their lives again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan and Desmond were quite happy with Mrs.
Warren, but missed Mr. Winthrop’s kindly advice and
friendship greatly. No trace of him had ever been
found, and a younger man now took his parochial
duties. Amateur detectives swarmed about the place,
but the villagers in a body refused shelter to every one.
Even the police officials themselves had to pitch tents
in fields near by for their own use, as no bribe was high
enough to obtain accommodation for them. Inspector
Vardon was beginning to get disheartened; he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>formed many theories during his stay, but upon minute
investigation they all fell to pieces.</p>

<p class='c012'>Walking away from the village one day, his hands
behind his back and his head sunk upon his breast, deep
in thought, he was suddenly awakened from his reverie
by the sound of groans. Hedges were on either side
of him, but he vaulted over the one from whence the
sounds came.</p>

<p class='c012'>There lay a sheep, its wool burnt away and its body
scorched. He examined the helpless creature in pity,
and the poor beast breathed his last. He was distinctly
puzzled. There was no sign of fire anywhere at all—the
poor animal alone had been hurt.</p>

<p class='c012'>He pondered for a moment, and the thought came
into his mind that perhaps this was a sequel to the
strange disappearances and mysteries he had been trying
to unravel—but after a moment, he cast the thought
aside as being impossible, and decided that the accident
must have been caused by a passer-by throwing away a
match or a lighted cigarette, so he hurried across the
fields to tell the farmer of his loss. That night,
however, he had cause to think more deeply over the
mishap to the sheep.</p>

<p class='c012'>About six in the evening Ezra Meakin and a companion
set out for Kiltown. They intended to stay the
night there and come back by the carrier in the morning.
At eight a shrieking, demented man came flying into
Marshfielden, and fell in a heap across the steps that
led up to the church.</p>

<p class='c012'>Matt Harding was near and ran to his aid.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good God, it’s Ezra!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was indeed, but a very different Ezra from the one
who had left Marshfielden only two hours before. His
clothes were scorched and his hair singed, while great
blisters, that could have been caused only by excessive
heat, marred his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What has come over ye, lad?” asked Matt in
concern.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The fire! The fire!” cried Ezra hysterically.
“It’s taken Luke—he’s gone,” and with the words he
lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Matt lifted him up in his strong arms, and bore him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to the nearest cottage. “Fetch the Inspector,” said
he curtly as he busied himself in trying to restore life
to the inanimate form on the bed. At length he
succeeded—a tremor passed through the body; the
hands unclasped; the eyelids fluttered slightly. Then
the lids slowly moved, and Matt stared down in horror
at the wide open eyes. Blindly he stumbled out of the
room, and fell into the arms of the Inspector.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter?” asked Vardon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Matt looked at him stupidly for a moment, and then
gave a harsh, mirthless laugh. “Ezra—he’s—he’s—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s blind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Blind?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Matt Harding could say no more, but sank down on
to a chair and buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a week Ezra lay delirious, and it was even longer
than that before any one could get his story from him.
When it came, it was disjointed and almost incoherent.
After he and Luke Wilden had walked about a mile, he
told them, they suddenly saw in the distance something
that looked like a red hot wire on the horizon. Dancing
and swaying it drew nearer to them, and fascinated
they watched to see what it could possibly be.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then suddenly, before they realized, it was upon
them. It swooped down and coiled around Luke’s
body, and carried him off into mid-air. As he tried to
drag Luke from its clutches, the end of it, in curling
around Luke still more firmly, struck him, and burnt
and blinded him. He remembered no more; everything
grew dim, and he fled down the long, straight
road towards the village, instinct guiding him in place
of his sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every one heard the story incredulously, and it duly
appeared in the London newspapers, and tended to
make the “Marshfielden Mystery” as it was called,
still more complicated and unfathomable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ezra recovered from the shock, but his eyesight was
gone forever.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Destroyed by fire,” was the verdict of the
eminent specialist who was called in to diagnose his
case.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The story of the “Light” grew daily more terrifying.
School children declared they saw it from the
windows of their class-rooms, and when closely
questioned about it, declared it was “a golden streak
of fire, as thin as wire, that came rushing through the
sky like lightning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then men began to watch for it, but somehow it
seemed to evade most of them, and for some time,
solitary statements were all that could be obtained with
reference to it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you make of it, Alan?” asked Desmond
one day, after it had been seen by three different witnesses
at the same time and in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know. Every one is not a liar, and at the
same time every one cannot suffer from a like optical
delusion. Every one who has seen this phenomenon
agrees in every detail about its appearance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, even the children,” supplemented Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s go for a walk,” yawned his cousin. “I feel
very tired to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Warren watched them going toward the gate
with apprehension in her eyes, and just as they were
about to pass through, she rushed to the door. “Be
you agoin’ out? Oh, do’ant ’ee go—do’ant ’ee—not
to-night! I be afeared—mortal afeared.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, we’ll take care of ourselves,” laughed
Desmond. “Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I’m afeared.” She shivered as she spoke—but
the boys laughed as they walked toward the Corlot
Woods, a favourite spot of theirs.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they crossed the stile leading to the path across
the fields, they heard a dog crying pitifully. Alan,
always tender-hearted towards dumb animals, stopped
and looked round. Again came the mournful cry.
“I think it must be across the way,” said Desmond.
Alan crossed the road, and then called out to his
cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s Slater’s pup”—he bent over it closely—“Why
its leg is broken and its fur is singed,” he added
in an awe-struck tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>A rustling sounded behind him—an intense heat that
nearly stifled him; he heard a sudden shriek—a groan.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Once more the  “Light”  had found its prey. Alan
was alone!</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c015'>“<i>Come at once. Something terrible has happened
to Dez. Don’t delay. Alan.</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such was the telegram that Sir John Forsyth received
upon arriving at his office the day after Desmond’s
disappearance. The two boys had kept him fully posted
with all the news at Marshfielden. But as he always
prided himself upon his strong common sense, he
laughed with the boys at the suggestion that the
“Curse”  was responsible for the strange happenings
in the little Derbyshire village.</p>

<p class='c012'>His face blanched as he read the message, and
instinctively he thought of the “Curse,” yet put the
thought aside as quickly as it came.</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters, his confidential secretary, almost friend,
looked at him pityingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to Marshfielden,”  announced Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall I come with you?”  asked Masters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Masters, I shall need you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An express leaves for Derby in half an hour,”  went
on Masters.  “If we book there, I can ’phone through
for a car to meet us and motor us direct to Grimland.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes! Yes! You arrange,” and Sir John, who
had grown as many years old as minutes had passed
since he had had the news, sat with his teeth chattering
and his limbs trembling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A  motor car will be waiting for us at Derby,”
announced Masters as they took their seats in the
train.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last the whistle sounded, the flag waved, and the
great engine snorted violently as it left the station.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John, in his anguish of mind, was unable to sit
still; up and down the corridor he walked until the
passengers began to pity his white, strained face, and
wondered what his trouble could be. Derby at last!
Then followed a mad ride to Grimland. Alan was
awaiting his Uncle at the pit head; he had not attempted
to go to bed since the  “Light”  had taken Desmond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>from his side. Silently they gripped hands, and Sir
John entered the little office and heard the whole
story.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan wound up by saying, “Even as I tell the story,
it seems almost incredible. As I turned round I saw
Desmond in mid-air, with, it seemed, a fiery wire about
him—and as I looked he vanished from sight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John was determined not to look upon it as witchcraft.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s man’s devilry, I’ll be bound,” said he. “I’ll
swear it’s not supernatural. Get all the scientists down—let
them make investigations. I’ll pay handsomely,
but discover the secret I will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The men, when they realized that Desmond had disappeared,
were shamefaced, and came to Mrs. Warren’s
cottage to offer their sympathy. They tried to atone
for their past conduct, by inviting both Alan and his
Uncle to stay in Marshfielden. But Alan refused.
“No, we’ll stay here,” said he. “Mrs. Warren has
made me very comfortable. But perhaps we’ll come
and visit Marshfielden, if we may, and do our utmost
to discover the perpetrator of this diabolical plot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, do ’ee sur, do ’ee,” said the men, and Alan
felt strangely cheered by their friendship.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John stayed with Alan for a fortnight, but as
others had disappeared, so had Desmond, and no trace
of him could be found. It was necessary for Sir John
to return to town, in order that he might keep his
business appointments and he asked Alan to accompany
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I curse the day I ever sent you to Grimland,” said
he over and over again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t upset yourself so, Uncle John! How could
anyone have foreseen such a calamity. No, I’ll stay
here, and perhaps I may be the means of unravelling
the mystery.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Police from the Continent, detectives from America,
Asiatic wizards and sorcerers all came to Marshfielden—but
none solved the mystery. For days no one
stirred out of doors, and when at length they
did so, it was with faltering steps and bated breath.
No one knew who would be the next victim of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>strange power that pervaded the place. Summer came
again! A year had passed and left its mark on the
once peaceful English village. Many white crosses
adorned the little churchyard, but of all the new ones,
few really marked the last resting place of those whose
names they bore. A tiny tombstone in the far corner,
under a weeping ash, named the spot consecrated to
the memory of little Jimmie Murlock, the first victim of
the “Light”.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moll Murlock had gone out of her mind. The shock
had turned her brain,—and when, one after another, she
learned of the tragedies that were daily coming on the
little village, her senses left her entirely, and she was
taken to the Kiltown asylum. Dan lived alone, in the
little cottage, his hair snow white, and his features old
and wrinkled; and none of his comrades dared recall
the past to his mind. The new vicar who had taken
Mr. Winthrop’s place was very unpopular, and on
Sundays the church was nearly half empty. Fear had
turned their thoughts from Heaven, and while men
openly cursed their God, the women whispered their
curses in their hearts.</p>

<p class='c012'>Inspector Vardon was still investigating, but his
reports to the Yard were all the same. “Nothing
further to hand” and then came the day when he
added “Fear this is beyond me” and the chiefs looked
at each other in dismay, as they feared it would remain
one of the unsolved mysteries of the day. They had no
shrewder or cleverer man in their employ than Marcus
Vardon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the “Light” suddenly disappeared. No more
losses were reported, things went on more calmly, and
women began to go out of doors more freely.
Children returned to school, and Marshfielden had
become almost normal again. For two months there
were no casualties, and people hoped that the evil
influence had departed for good, or burnt itself
out.</p>

<p class='c012'>And the next Sunday the new clergyman addressed
from his pulpit a full church. The people had once
more come to the house of God for comfort and to
return Him thanks for the cessation of the past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>horrors. And his voice shook as he gave out his text,
from the one hundred and twenty-first psalm:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; the Lord shall
preserve thy going out and thy coming in, from this time
forth for ever more.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE OUTLET</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For over six months Marshfielden was unvisited by the
“Light”. The inhabitants were settling down and
work had begun again in earnest. Alan had been
promoted second overseer at the mine, and as he had
a firm way with the men, those under him worked
diligently and well. Traces of sorrow were left on
every one’s face. It was impossible to eradicate them
in a few months; years would not wipe away the
affliction that had come into their lives.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little village was opened up now. Motors
traversed its cobbled streets, and the inhabitants so
far allowed themselves to become “modernized” that
the sign “Teas provided here” could be seen in nearly
every cottage window down the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>The influx of so many strangers made them forget
the “Curse” and as once they believed in it, now
they believed just as firmly that the disasters that had
come upon them were wrought by some human agency.
These six months of peace and quiet they hoped were
precursors of the future. Inspector Vardon left the
place, and nothing remained outwardly to remind them
of the terrible past.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then suddenly they woke up once more to sorrow.
Two horses were found to be missing, and with them
the little stable boy who tended them. The “Light”
had returned!</p>

<p class='c012'>Once more voices were hushed and heads were shaken
gravely, as every one talked of the tragedy. A week
passed, then Mrs. Skeet disappeared, and a few days
later Mary Slater. The place swarmed again with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>detectives; the papers were again alive with the
renewal of the tragedies.</p>

<p class='c012'>The men in the mine worked silently; the only thing
to break the stillness was the sound of the picks on
the coal seams, or the running of the trolleys up and
down the roads. Each feared to think of the horror
that might await him when he reached his home at
the end of his day’s work.</p>

<p class='c012'>The dinner hour came round, and each man sat silent
and glum, eating his bread and meat, and uttering
only a monosyllable now and again to his particular
chum.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly there came a dull roar; the men rose to
their feet in haste. They knew only too well that
ominous sound—it was familiar to them all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Dickson appeared, his face ashen. “An
explosion in the South Road,” said he. “Rescue
parties to work at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In an instant everything was forgotten but the one
desire to help their brothers in distress. With picks
and ropes and lanterns they hurried down the main
road, just at the bend of which a sheet of flame flared
out suddenly, entirely enveloping the first man, and
setting his clothing on fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>In vain they played on the flames—it was useless.
The fire had gained too much power. The rescuers
were forced back to the cage at the bottom of the shaft,
and all had to seek refuge above. Another sorrow
had come upon the people of Marshfielden—their cup
was full to overflowing as it was, yet Tragedy, the
Humourist, was not yet content with his handiwork.</p>

<p class='c012'>For two days the fire raged, and the willing rescuers
were helpless in the face of such odds; on the third it
quieted sufficiently to enable a rescue party to descend.
Gradually they fought the flames, but not a trace
remained of the men who had been caught like rats
in a trap when the first explosion came. So Marshfielden
was again in mourning, and broken-hearted
widows and fatherless children went to the touching
little memorial service that was arranged for the lost
ones.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was horror-stricken at the calamity that had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>befallen the mine. The thought of the men who had
been burnt to death preyed on his mind; it was his first
experience of such an accident, and it left upon him
an indelible mark.</p>

<p class='c012'>The mine was once more in working order, and he
was doing some accounts in the office below, when a
voice startled him. It was the voice of Mr. Dickson,
and very grave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go at once to the third shaft, Forsyth,” said he.
“The telephone has failed, and Daniels has reported
that there is something wrong with the air pumps
there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What? In the lower engine house?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. We can get no further information. Make
a careful examination, and if you suspect any danger,
order the shift off and close the gates.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very good,” and Alan, glad to have something
to do that would occupy his mind, left the office, and
jumped on to one of the empty trolleys that was being
run by the cable to the second shaft, and would take
him very near his destination. At the second shaft
there were anxious faces.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something wrong at number three shaft, sir,” said
one of the men. “Daniels ’phoned us, but before he
could tell us anything definite, the connections broke
down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks,” said Alan shortly. “How many men are
working there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“None, sir. They’ve not been working it to-day.
Daniels and two other men have been inspecting a
bulge that has appeared in the roof, and were arranging
to have it fixed up with supports.” Mechanically
Alan walked down the low road that led to the third
shaft. He pushed aside the heavy tarpaulins that hung
across the roadways, and kept the current of air from
flowing in the wrong direction, and as he passed
through each one, he sniffed the air eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last! The sickly, choking smell came up from
the distance. It was one he knew and feared—a
noxious gas. The roof became very low, and Alan
had almost to crawl on his hands and knees, for there
was no room for him to stand upright. Cramped,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>aching, he made his way along the narrow roadway.
Suddenly he gave a sigh of relief; the roof rose to
perhaps ten feet, and the road widened out into a
vault-like chamber, perhaps twenty feet square. He
heard a cry in the distance. “Help! Help!” It was
Daniels—Daniels who came stumbling in and fell on
the ground before him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Forsyth,” he muttered, “run—save yourself—Rutter
is dead—The gas is terrible. There’s
danger,” and even as he spoke there came a dull roar
and a flash, a terrible sound of falling—and Alan
realized that the little chamber had indeed become a
vault, for the force of the explosion had made the
walls on either side cave in, and the entrance at each
end was blocked up completely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Too late,” murmured Daniels weakly. “I couldn’t
get here before.” He fumbled at his belt, and Alan
bent over him gently. “Water—water,” he cried, and
Alan unfastened the basket that was slung across his
shoulders, and took from it a bottle of cold tea.</p>

<p class='c012'>But even as he put it to the lips of the sick man, there
came another roar in the distance, and Daniels fell
back—dead.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once more the dreaded sound was heard—once more
an explosion had occurred in the mine. This time
there was little fire—only water—water everywhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Mr. Alan?” asked the manager hoarsely.
“Has he returned from the third shaft?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then he is in the midst of the danger. Rescue
parties at once.” But all these efforts were in vain.
It was water this time—water that drove the men back
to the mouth of the pit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pumps were put in order, and for hours the men
worked to clear the mine, but when at last they were
able to get near the spot where the accident took
place—they, as they feared, found no trace of
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>From the second shaft the mine was in such a
complete state of wreckage and ruin, that it would
take weeks before it was even possible to get near the
third shaft and the original scene of the disaster. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>once more a casualty list was sent out, and this time
was headed by the name</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Alan Forsyth</i>”.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Sir John heard the news with a set face. First
Desmond, now Alan had been taken from him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t take it so to heart, Mr. Dickson,” said he
kindly. “The boy was doing his duty when death
overtook him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am broken-hearted, Sir John,” said Mr. Dickson.
“I feel that it was I who drove him to his doom. If
I hadn’t sent him to the third shaft that day, he would
be with us still.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is fate,” said Sir John simply.</p>

<p class='c012'>But when he reached his office next day, he told
Masters to get him his will from the safe. With
trembling fingers he tore it across, threw the pieces in
the fire and watched it burn. Then he said quietly, “I
must make a new will, Masters. But to whom shall
I leave my money? There is no one to follow me
now.” Suddenly he took up pen and paper and wrote
hurriedly. “Fetch a clerk, Masters,” said he, and
when a clerk appeared he added quietly, “I want you
both to witness my signature to my will,” and with
firm fingers wrote his name, and passed the paper over
to Masters, making no effort to hide what he had
written.</p>

<p class='c012'>And Masters’ eyes grew dim as he read—</p>

<p class='c015'>“Everything I possess to the ‘Miners’ Fund’ for widows
and orphans, rendered such by accidents in the mine.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c012'>When Alan recovered from the shock of the
explosion, he found his lamp was still burning dimly,
and felt that he had a dull ache in his legs. He was
covered with débris from head to foot and stifling
from the dust and powdered coal that was all about.
With difficulty he extricated himself, and realized that
Daniels was completely buried.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alone in the little chamber, a feeling akin to superstition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>came over him, and he moved away from the
silent form, now shrouded in coal. Scarcely realizing
the hopeless position he was in, he leant back, and
closing his eyes, his worn out nerves gave way, and he
fell asleep. He woke up with a start some hours
later; his watch had stopped and he had no idea of the
time. Madness seemed to be coming over him; his
face was flushed, his head throbbed. He was ravenously
hungry, and crossed to the dead man’s side and
searched about until he found the basket that contained
Daniel’s untouched dinner, and the bottle of cold tea.
There was not a great deal of food—half a loaf, several
thick slices of beef, a piece of cheese and some homemade
apple tart.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan ate sparingly, for although his stomach
clamoured for more, he realized that not yet was his
greatest hour of need, and that later on he would need
the food still more.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he had finished, he took up a pick and wildly
struck at the blocked exit, but only the echoes replied,
laughing at his impotence. Flinging his tool down he
buried his head in his hands and sobbed in bitter
despair. His convulsive outburst left him calmer, and
he began for the first time to think out a plan of escape.
He knew that rescue parties would be working hard
for his release—but could they reach him in time?</p>

<p class='c012'>There was around him a death-like stillness, and he
realized that the buried cavern was far from the
bottom of the shaft. Then he suddenly wondered
where the air came from. There must be an inlet
somewhere, he thought, for the air he was breathing,
although stuffy, was quite pure. He walked round
the walled up chamber—round and round—but there
was nowhere a weak spot. He sat down and tried to
think coherently, and laughed aloud in his agony, as
he wondered whether he would go mad. He looked
up suddenly, and in his weakness imagined that the roof
was trying to dance with the floor. He tottered round
the place, hardly able to keep his feet in his wild fancy
that the floor was moving, and laughed hysterically as
he knocked against a jutting piece of coal, and thought
the roof had got him at last. Then he quieted a little,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and in the semi-darkness the dead figure of Daniels
seemed to rise from the place where it lay, and point
at him a menacing finger.</p>

<p class='c012'>In terror, Alan backed to the further side of the
little chamber, his eyes distorted, his limbs trembling.
He watched the figure come nearer—nearer—its long
claw-like fingers were almost on his flesh—“Ah!”
he shrieked—the fingers were touching him with a
cold, slimy touch. He felt impelled to move forward—with
the forefinger of the dead man pressed to his
forehead. He walked fearfully onward—then his overwrought
brain gave way entirely, and with another
wild shriek, he fell to the floor in merciful unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he recovered, his dimmed senses hid from him
much of the past. His fever had abated, but he
longed for water. His mouth was parched. He
crawled feebly to the basket where the dead Daniels
had kept his food, and drew out the bottle of tea.
There was very little left, but enough to take away the
first keen edge of his thirst. A torn newspaper that
had been used to wrap up some of the food rustled
slightly. It startled him and he looked round
nervously. Again it moved, and seemed to be lifted
up by some unseen hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>He watched it fascinated, then suddenly his face
lighted up. “A draught,” he cried triumphantly.
“Then it is from that direction I must try and secure
my release!” With renewed energy he began to
pick at the coal, in the fast dimming light of his
lantern. Tirelessly he worked, until success met his
efforts and he had made a hole big enough to crawl
through, whence came the sound of rushing waters.</p>

<p class='c012'>He lifted his lantern above his head in his endeavour
to discover where he was, and its feeble rays shone
upon a swiftly flowing, subterranean river that disappeared
through a tunnel on either side. The place
he was in was very small and had no outlet except
by way of the water.</p>

<p class='c012'>The river was narrow, perhaps four feet wide at the
most, but with a current so strong that Alan, good
swimmer though he was, would not have dared trust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>himself to its cruel-looking depths. Mechanically he
dropped into the water a lump of coal. There was a
slight splash—but no sound came to tell him that it
had reached the bottom. He felt in his pockets, and
found half a ball of string. Tying a piece of coal to
one end he dropped it into the rapids, but his arm was
up to his shoulder in the river, and yet the coal had not
touched the bottom.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at the water curiously, and dabbled his
fingers in the brackish fluid. Suddenly a pain in his
hand made him draw it out quickly, and by the light
of the lantern he saw it was covered with blood. As
he wiped it clean he saw the impression of two teeth
on his first and third fingers. Slowly his lips moved
and he murmured—“There is animal life in this river
then—I wonder whither it leads—can there be
humanity near too?”</p>

<p class='c012'>His lantern was nearly out, and by its dying rays
he tried frantically to fashion himself a raft, upon
which he could trust himself to the waters. A trolley,
smashed by the force of the explosion, lay near him.
The wheels had been wrenched off and it was all in
pieces. He looked at it carefully. The bottom
piece was intact with half of one end still in position.
He examined it critically. Would it float? Well he
must risk that. He thought it would, and the end
piece would serve as a hold to keep him on safely.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was feeling faint—he ate the remains of his
food, and with a reverent glance at the place where
Daniels lay, he pushed the plank out on to the
seething waters. Lightly he jumped on it himself,
and, with a tight grip on the projecting pieces of
wood, gave himself up to the mercy of the torrent.</p>

<p class='c012'>His lantern went out; the darkness was intense;
there was no sound but the lashing of the waters
and the drumming of the raft against the sides of
the tunnel. The current was swifter than anything
he had ever known. The water just tore along at a
breakneck speed, lashed over the frail raft and
drenched Alan to the skin. He was faint. In a dim
way he thought of his life—how empty it had been.
Where was Desmond—and Uncle John? Cambridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>came before his eyes, and he could almost see the
serene picture of the “backs” with their quaint
bridges and fields beyond.</p>

<p class='c012'>He felt stiff. Mechanically he held on to the raft,
even when his senses left him; and the frail wood with
its worn burden of humanity, rushed on, down into
the depths, carried by the river that was descending
lower and lower through the earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly the raft gave a still more violent jerk, and
Alan awoke to life once more. The rapids were over
at last, and he was drifting along in waters that were
as sluggish now as before they had been fast.</p>

<p class='c012'>The tunnel widened, and he was aware that the
intense blackness had gone, and in its place there was
a purplish light that was soothing to his aching eyes.
As the tunnel began to widen out, a path branched off
at either side of the water.</p>

<p class='c012'>The raft drifted on and at last found a harbour in a
little, natural bay hollowed out in the bank. Alan
stepped on land at last, his senses reeling. He had no
idea of the time that had passed since he first started
on that strange journey, and he felt hungry, weak and
tired.</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly he walked along the river bank, and the
purple lights grew stronger—then voices came upon
his ear, and as he eagerly bent forward toward the
unknown that faced him, above in Marshfielden, the
clergyman was saying—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line'>“And for the soul of Alan Forsyth—lately dead.”</div>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>A STRANGE MEETING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The ever present sense of “self-preservation” beats
within the breasts of men most strongly at some period
or other of their lives. It showed itself to Alan now.
A fear of the supernatural came over him, and very
quietly he stepped into the shelter of a jutting piece
of rock, from which, all unseen, he could take a view
of his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>He realized at once that it was to no mine that he
had come, for strange, fantastic figures flitted about
in the distance, figures that did not belong to the
upper world.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly several of these figures leapt into the water
and with a peculiar roll came swimming towards him
at a terrific pace, and with a graceful movement vaulted
out of the water and sat on the edge of the bank. He
counted five of them, and saw that they were quite
naked, and their skins were of a most peculiar purple
shade, an almost exact match to the purple that
lighted the place. They were talking volubly in an
unknown tongue, and Alan leant forward from his
hiding place to catch a better view of these strange,
underworld people he had come among in such an
extraordinary way. Short—he would judge them to
be no more than three feet six, at the most, but with
muscles that stood out like iron bands across their
bodies. Their hair, in contrast to their skins, was of
an almost flaxen hue, and in the females hung perfectly
straight to their waists. The men wore theirs cropped
close, except on the very top of their heads, where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>was allowed to grow long, and was plaited and braided,
and fixed with ornaments.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their features were extremely pointed, and their eyes
were small, but of a piercing brilliance. From the
middle of the forehead, grew a tusk or horn, about ten
inches long. For some time Alan puzzled over the
strange horn, but its use was demonstrated to him only
too soon. It was a weapon of offence. One of the
women suddenly rose, and began an unintelligible
tirade against her companion. The man did his best
to pacify her, but it was useless, and suddenly she bent
down, and with a viciousness Alan could hardly realize,
thrust her tusk into the man’s face, and with a wild
shriek dived into the water and swam away. The man
was left with a gaping wound on his cheek, from which
flowed a sickly, purply-white fluid. With hoarse
chuckles, the remaining three swam off, leaving the
man alone. Alan watched him intently. Diving to the
bottom of the river, the creature stayed there an
incredibly long time, and then reappeared with a bunch
of purple water weeds in his hand. He laid a handful
of these weeds on his wound, to which they adhered by
a secretion of their own, and the man swam away also,
leaving Alan more alone than before.</p>

<p class='c012'>His faintness grew still more unbearable and he came
out of his hiding place, caring for nothing but to get
food; but his limbs were weak, and he fell, and found
that he could hardly drag himself along. As he lay on
the ground, a sweet smell assailed his nostrils, and looking
round he realized that on little low bushes all about
him, hung a luscious-looking, purple fruit.</p>

<p class='c012'>He picked one and examined it. It was like a grape
in size and appearance, but was velvet to the touch,
like a peach. He tasted it—it was sweet and wonderfully
refreshing, so he ate his fill, with his last ounce
of strength pulled himself once more into the friendly
arms of the overhanging rocks, and fell asleep. When
he awoke he made another meal off the fruit that grew
everywhere in such abundance—it was filling and
seemed nutritious, and the juice appeased his thirst.
He looked carefully around him. There was no one
about, and keeping within the shadow of the walls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>he made his way down the path. It was not an easy
road, for the stones were sharp and the way rough,
and the constant effort to keep himself hidden tired
him. At last he came to the end of the passage, and
saw that the river widened out into a large lake, about
two hundred yards across. Peculiar craft lay moored
at either side, and in the centre was an island on which
grew purple vegetation—short, stunted, purple trees,
and a peculiar, purple moss, that covered the ground
like grass.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a weirdly picturesque scene. Purple light
shone from purple trees that were planted at regular
intervals everywhere. The light seemed to evolve from
nothing, as it showed under the large purple leaves
that acted as shades—yet Alan believed it was partly
natural, and partly controlled by the power of the
purple people he had seen.</p>

<p class='c012'>A wide passage went to the right, and in front of
him Alan saw a large chamber, bounded on one side
by the lake. Branching off in all directions were
other passages which seemed to open out into other
chambers and roadways, in fact the whole place seemed
like a veritable warren.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly an awful crash sounded, followed by the
beating of drums and the clashing of cymbals and
away in the distance he saw a procession of purple
folk passing rapidly, all in the same direction. Cloaks
of the same purple hue fell from their shoulders, and
the women wore veils on their heads. He watched
them with interest. The figures passed in quick
succession, then they became less and less frequent,
until only one or two stragglers came hurrying up.
The sound of singing rose on the air, and Alan conjectured
that it must be some religious service to which
they all were bent. After the last one had disappeared
Alan waited some minutes to see if any more would
pass, but as no one else came he walked slowly in the
direction from which the multitude had appeared.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a very short space of time he found himself in a
street. Peculiar huts lined either side of it, huts with
their doors open wide and no sign of life. He looked
about him carefully, and ventured inside one. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>found it was divided into three rooms—all on the
ground floor. There was a sleeping room, for
mattresses of that same purple moss, dried, were on
the floor; there was also a living room and a kitchen.
Warily he looked about him, and then went out into
the street. The main street merged into smaller ones
and at last, at the very end, a large building rose upon
the scene—larger and more impressive than any of the
others he had passed on his way. All this time he
had seen no sign of life—the inhabitants were content
to rest secure in their belief of inviolability.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cautiously Alan crept toward the building and as he
came close to it, he saw that a sentry had been left
on guard—a sentry with an evil-looking knife slung
across his shoulders, and a scimitar-like instrument in
his hand. The man was looking away into the distance
and did not hear Alan’s approach. “Hullo,” said
Alan pleasantly. The effect was magical. The
undersized creature swung round and faced the
strange, white man. For an instant he remained quite
still, and then, with a sudden movement that Alan was
unprepared for, sprang at him, and commenced to
beat his horn in Alan’s face. In vain the white man
tried to free himself from the savage grip; he was no
match for this strange creature of the underworld.
His adversary made no sound as he gradually
weakened Alan, and at length he swung him over his
shoulder as if he had been a child, and marched with
him at a quick pace down the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>The shock, the strenuous time Alan had been
through, took his senses away, and when he came to,
he found he was lying on a soft mattress and there
was a stabbing pain in his arm. A fantastic figure
was bending over him, a figure that licked its lips
cruelly as it surveyed its victim, and Alan realized at
once that he was in an enemy’s hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>The figure spoke to him, but Alan was unable to
understand the jargon it uttered. Suddenly it issued
a command, and four men, clad in a kind of armour,
came up to Alan, and lifting him up carried him once
more out of the place into the street. Outside they
placed him on a litter, drawn by four men, and at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>fast trot dragged him through the streets. The air
grew hotter and hotter, until Alan felt choked; at last,
however, they came to their journey’s end, and Alan
was rudely hauled out of the litter, and found himself
standing outside high gates. They were very massive,
of a gold colour, and heavily barred on the inner side.
One of his captors struck a gong affixed to the wall,
and in answer to its strident tones, two women, heavily
veiled, came running toward them and unfastened the
locks. Alan was almost too weak to walk, but was
pushed along a passage until he found himself in a
place so vast, so wonderful, so awful, that it left him
breathless and trembling.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a huge temple into which he had been
brought—so vast that he was unable to see the further
end of it. An enormous high altar stood near him, and
at intervals were smaller ones all round the walls.
Statues and images, both grotesque and beautiful,
ornamented the place, and the atmosphere reeked with
a pungent incense that was sickly and overpowering.
But it was not only the vastness and weirdness that
left Alan breathless—it was a wonder more terrible,
more awe-inspiring than his mind had ever conceived.</p>

<p class='c012'>The whole of the centre of the temple was composed
of a fire—a fire that ran down the length of the
elliptically shaped building, and disappeared in the
distance in a red glow. A glass-like wall rose to
perhaps three feet above the level of the flames, and
through it Alan could see into the heart of a bottomless
pit of fire, whose flames of all hues danced and
swerved and shimmered in a wild ecstasy. The substance
of the fire he could not guess—but the fire
possessed a terrifying appearance that alone was
enough to break the spirit of any mortal man.</p>

<p class='c012'>The heat was intense, yet the natives did not seem
to notice it, and they led Alan to a pillar that rose
near the high altar, bound him to it by a heavy chain,
and then left him there, alone. He watched his captors
disappear one by one. His brain was reeling. He
wondered whether all he had seen was but the result
of fever, and he would wake up presently to find
himself in Mrs. Slater’s pretty little cottage at Marshfielden.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But no, he knew he was awake and not
dreaming,—and looked about him in bewilderment.
That there were people living in the centre of the
earth he would never have believed—yet here was the
proof—for was he not a captive in their clutches?</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked at the fire. Never before had he seen
anything like it. It seemed to go deep into fathomless
depths, and its flames danced and sang and crackled
maliciously. He wondered whether he would be
thrown into its fiery bosom by the purple folk, and
shivered to think of it, but then a feeling of relief
came over him. After all it would be a quick death,
for nothing could live long in those hungry flames.</p>

<p class='c012'>Immediately opposite him was the high altar. Six
steps led up to it, and he looked with interest at them
and at the red stains they bore; and with an uncanny
laugh, asked himself whether these were blood. If
so, whose? Round the walls on pedestals were huge,
grotesque figures; and interposed here and there, an
image of almost seraphic beauty, that contrasted
strangely with the insidious cruelty and hideousness of
the place.</p>

<p class='c012'>To the right of Alan was a still more grotesque
figure. About twenty feet high it stood, with cruel
eyes looking out across the fire. Its jaws were open
wide, and attached to the under jaw was a peculiar
slide made of the same transparent glass-like substance
that encircled the flames. This slide reached from the
idol’s mouth to the edge of the furnace, and suddenly
drops of perspiration stood out thick on Alan’s brow.
The meaning of the slide was only too clear. The
victims of these underground savages were forced
inside the idol, disgorged by it on to the slide, and
thrown into the fire—a living sacrifice. Time passed,
and Alan wondered dimly whether he would ever be
able to reckon it again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly upon his ear came wild yells and fanatical
shrieks, the banging of drums, the clashing of cymbals
followed by discordant singing. Then the din quieted
a little, only to reassert itself once more as the natives
reached the door of their temple. Alan gasped in
horror as a horde of grinning purple men swarmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>into the place, two of whom left their places in the
procession, and coming to him caught hold of him
roughly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Priests and acolytes took their place in the procession,
which was brought to an end by a high priest,
who wore the most wonderful purple robes and purple
gems; slowly he walked to the high altar, his richly
embroidered vestments hanging to the ground, and two
acolytes carried the ends of his cloak, which they kissed
reverently as they ascended the bloody steps. When
he reached the top step he turned his back on the altar
itself, and prostrated himself before the fire, the whole
company of worshippers following his example. Boys
arrayed in vestments almost the facsimile of the ones
worn by the high priest, swung censers aloft, which
exuded their sickly perfume, and sent the faint, blue
smoke mingling with the smokeless flames of the big
fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then they rose and the ceremony began, priests
intoned; an invisible choir sang; and the congregation
chanted, while live pigs, oxen, horses and goats were
thrown alive into the flames. There was a wild shriek
from each animal as it felt the heat, a crackling—and it
was reduced to ashes. Alan wondered when his turn
would come, and longed vainly for the blessed relief of
unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly his captors lifted him high above their heads,
and strapped him to the altar. And then in front of
him was placed a goat, and two priests, disengaging
themselves from the crowd, disembowelled the animal
alive, flung the still living and tortured creature to the
flames, and stood over Alan with their ugly knives, still
dripping with blood, suspended above him. Then the
steel came flashing down and he wondered that he felt
no pain, but he realized that his clothes had been deftly
cut away from him, and he was left on the altar slab,
naked. Incense was wafted over him, and he was
bathed from head to foot in sweet smelling oils. Then
he was released from the altar and had to submit to
being robed from head to foot in purple garments.
Sandals were placed upon his feet, and for a moment
he wondered whether these people really meant him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>well—but even as the thought passed through his mind,
the back of the great idol swung open on hinges, revealing
a flight of steps within; and Alan knew the hour of
his torture had come.</p>

<p class='c012'>With incense rising to his nostrils and the noisy
clangour of bells in his ears, Alan was led, powerless,
although resisting, to the open doorway. The steps
inside were heated until they blistered his feet, and the
pain caused him to mount higher where he hoped to get
relief. When he reached the topmost step, and stood
in comfort, realizing that it was cool, the door below
swung to. He was alone, and saw that he was standing
in the head of the idol, looking through its gaping
jaws into the heart of the fire. Then suddenly he felt
a jolt beneath him, and realized that his ankles were
encased in iron bands. Again the idol’s body shook,
and he was thrown on his belly. Slowly the slide was
coming into position; another convulsive move of the
idol, and he was half way down it, and smiled as he
saw in imagination a tank of water below him in place
of the fire, and himself in a bathing suit, ready to
descend the water chute!</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly, slowly he began to slip, and wondered why
he did not go faster. He tried to kick his feet and so
enable himself to get over with death—but the iron
anklets were holding him fast, and he knew he would
reach the flames only when his torturers desired it.
The heat was now unbearable; the flames were leaping
up toward him; he already felt upon his cheek their
fiery breath. His arms were stretched out before him,
and he was at too great an angle to draw them up.
Then came a feeling of excruciating agony, an agony
almost unbearable. His fingers had reached the fire!
powerless to take them out, he writhed round and round
in a vain endeavour to obtain relief. No sound came
from between his clenched teeth to express the pain he
was enduring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly above the uproar he heard a woman’s voice,
commanding and imperious. There was a sudden
silence, and then, with a terrible jolting of the idol,
Alan once again found the slide rising and he was safe
inside the belly of the image. Tears trickled down his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>face, tears of pain. Of course the mechanism had gone
wrong. All that excruciating torture would have to
be borne again. He held his mutilated hands out in
front of him. Numbness had set in and intense cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>The door in the idol opened and a beautiful girl
mounted the steps and came toward him. She was
small, like her companions around her, and of the same
colour, and the horn in her forehead, painted gold and
hung with gems, seemed in some weird way to enhance
her beauty. Almost of English mould, her features
were small and pretty, and her wonderful hair hung
like a mantle of gold far past her knees. Upon her
head she wore a crown of gold, and Alan thought she
must be queen of the underworld people, for evidently
her power was paramount. She placed her cool, firm
hands on Alan’s shoulder, and led him down the now
cool stairs; and once more he found himself in the
temple. He was dazed, and could hardly realize that
this woman had saved him. From a basket an
attendant carried she took ointments and healing
lotions, and bathed and bound up his poor, maimed
hands. The effect was almost magical. The burning
ceased, and a feeling of relief came over him. She
then offered him her arm, and led him to the outer gates
of the temple. There a small chariot was awaiting her,
pulled by a hideous beast that was the beast of burden
in the underworld. Small, with an ungainly body and
short legs—its head small in proportion, it had immense
tusks and a beard covered the lower portions of its
face. Indeed, the “Schloun” was a mixture of
rhinoceros and goat, and had the bulldog’s squareness
of build. It was a hideous animal, and Alan shuddered
as he took his place in the chariot. The equipage
was extremely comfortable, the floor, upon which they
sat was laden with rugs and cushions, and side by side,
the man and his protector rode through the strange
streets of this underground world.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last they stopped in front of an imposing building,
even larger than the one where Alan had originally
been captured. The woman led Alan into it, and took
him into an apartment that was evidently reserved for
her private use. A soft, purple carpet lined the floor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>while purple curtains hung across the door. The
woman pointed to a cushion and sat down, and Alan,
understanding her meaning, sat down near her. She
spoke to him slowly and repeatedly, but he was unable
to understand her tongue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Kaweeka” she repeated over and over again, and
at last he understood. It was her name!</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he rose and went to the door and called
“Kaweeka” and the woman smiled and nodded and
tapped her heel on the ground to signify her delight.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly she rose and stood beside him, and putting
her arms about him, planted a very English kiss full
upon his mouth. Alan who had never flirted, never
cared for any girl, when he was in England, felt his
pulses leap and a wild thrill pass through him at the
touch of her lips. Then a sense of shame came over
him. What was she? Why, hardly human. If he
succeeded in getting to the upper world again, and took
her with him, scientists would want to cage her as a
newly discovered animal! Could he wed her?—marriage?—love?—passion?—he
knew too well which
sense she had aroused when her lips touched his.</p>

<p class='c012'>He drew away from her in loathing, and a hard light
came into her eyes as she imperiously put her lips up
to his. Her fascination was undeniable, but there was
something unholy, almost unclean, about her; and
although passion shook him from head to foot, he
turned away and walked to the other side of the apartment.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Kaweeka followed him. She twined her arms
about his neck and drew his head against her breast,
and he felt the wild throbbing of a heart next to his.
“Kaweeka,” he cried, “Kaweeka.” And he drew her
to him still closer, forgetting all else but that a warm
living thing was lying in his arms, and that thing a
woman.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly Kaweeka disengaged herself, and with a
low laugh intimated to Alan that she wished him to
follow her. She led the way through a long corridor,
up a flight of wide and softly carpeted stairs to a room
on the second floor. It was a wonderful apartment,
unlike anything he had ever seen, and even as he looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>about him, he heard a low chuckle, and Kaweeka disappeared
through the door, fastening it behind her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan drew a breath of relief. The air seemed purer
for her absence, and he looked round him curiously.
Low divans furnished the room, and on a wonderful
table of crystal was food and wine. He was hungry
and faint from his experience in the temple, and he fell
to on the repast that had been provided and felt the
better for it.</p>

<p class='c012'>In one corner of the room stood a large jar of bright
yellow porcelain, and it was filled with blue, green,
yellow and purple fungi—flowers they could not be
called—but as fungi they were almost beautiful. Their
stems were long and bare of leaf, and the flower
bloomed at the very top. Some of the “flowers”
were almost like poppy heads, others like variegated
mushrooms—while one or two blooms at least reminded
Alan most forcibly of the pretty pink seaweed he had
admired when on a holiday at Rozel in Jersey. The
vividness of colouring made a wonderful effect against
the purple background and if his position had not been
so hopeless, he would have thoroughly enjoyed his
strange adventure.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were no windows in the room—at least not
what the world above would understand by the word—but
there was an opening overlooking the narrow causeway
that served to let in light and air. There was no
shutter to it, only heavy purple draperies hung at
either side, which could be drawn across if privacy was
desired.</p>

<p class='c012'>In two corners of the room were tall braziers, and
Alan touched the large switch that protruded from
them. Instantly the room was flooded with the soft,
purple light that seemed to exude from the trees; and
Alan felt that his first conjecture was right—the trees
possessed some natural light which the natives had
learnt to control, and which they ran along the branches
much in the same way that we run electricity along
cables. At any rate the result was very pleasing, and
the light possessed none of the glare that is characteristic
of electricity.</p>

<p class='c012'>His investigations being finished he inspected a heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>curtain that was draped across the wall nearest the
“window” opening. He pulled it aside, and behind
it was revealed a door. It was made on the sliding
principle, and as it moved slightly he saw revealed
before him a room that seemed almost an exact replica
of the apartment he was in. Carefully he stepped
inside—and there in the further corner, he saw a low
mattress, and in the semi darkness he thought he saw
it move ever so slightly. He drew back startled, but
on his ears came the sound of deep breathing: some
one or something was sleeping there. He moved
cautiously toward it, and saw the figure of a man
lying on the couch. Suddenly the sleeper turned over,
leaving his face exposed to view. Alan uttered an
exclamation that awoke the sleeping man. For a
moment there was silence and then a great cry rang
on the air—“My God—it’s Alan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dez, old boy!” cried his cousin, his sobs coming
thick and fast. “Dez! Thank God I’ve found you.
Steady, boy, steady—it’s two against those purple devils
now,” and the strong man bent low and sobbed as if
his heart would break.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE ORIGIN OF THE PEOPLE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For some time after the cousins met again so strangely,
they could only grasp each other’s hands—their hearts
were too full for words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m like a silly woman,” said Desmond at last
“but oh! Alan, I seem to have been in this Hell a
lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor old boy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No one to speak to but Kaweeka—no one to look
at but Kaweeka—always Kaweeka—until I felt I should
go mad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did you get here?” asked Alan at last. “We
were never able to discover the origin of the Light.
Oh,” he shuddered, “I shall never forget seeing you
carried off—whirling through space—it was terrible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Desmond began his story in a quick jerky way,
as if eager to get it done. “The Light came upon me
so suddenly, I didn’t realize what had happened. All
I knew was—that I had a fearful burning sensation
round my waist—and that I was being carried through
space. Then came a descent through darkness which
seemed to last a lifetime. I seemed to be going on and
on—and then suddenly I found myself in the presence
of the high priest in the temple here. I have no
recollection of how I reached it—I think I must have
lost consciousness and then—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well I felt so ill after the journey that the rest
seems all hazy. I know I participated in some of their
vile religious ceremonies. I was forced into the belly
of Mzata—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Is that the idol?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. I remember the heat was overpowering.
Then before I realized anything else, Kaweeka came
and rescued me. She carried me here, and—well, old
chap, the rest isn’t pleasant. The woman is a fiend.
Down here there is no one for her to allure, and as I
believe I was the first white man to get here alive, she
gave me the benefit of her powerful wiles. She
admitted me into a kind of harem, in which I am”—he
laughed bitterly—“her chief husband.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My God,” said Alan hoarsely, “You have married
her, Desmond?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond nodded. “I suppose that’s what it is—but
I don’t understand much of what she says. At any
rate I was taken to the temple and after a long ceremony,
she came forward and acknowledged me before
the congregation. Time after time I’ve been within an
ace of killing myself, for the situation is unbearable.
But she has spies everywhere and every chance has
been taken from me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can you understand her tongue?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, up to now I have only managed a very few
words. I know her name. I know that Mzata is the
god of their temple,—but I cannot get further than
that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you do all day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing! What is there to do? I go out and
Kaweeka accompanies me, caressing me the whole
time. Should she not come—then I am followed by her
spies. The natives watch me with suspicion; they seem
to lick their, lips as I pass, and long to fall upon me
and throw me to the flames. I’ve seen sights since
I’ve been here, and heard sounds that would make the
strongest man tremble. Alan,” solemnly, “I’ve seen
human beings—human beings that we knew in Marshfielden—people
we respected and loved—thrown to the
fire through the medium of Mzata. I saw Mrs. Skeet
brought here—shrieking—sobbing—crying—and I saw
her thrown into the belly of the idol. I was in the
temple and rushed forward to save her, even if death
had been my reward—but Kaweeka gave a signal and
I was seized and bound and forced to witness her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>tortures. She saw me and recognized me, and as she
was sent nearer and nearer the flames she cried to me
to aid her. ‘Mr. Desmond! Save me! Save me!’
she shrieked, and do you know, Alan, as the flames
closed over her body, I heard ‘Mr. Desmond! Save
me!’ come wailing up through the fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then that is the grave of all the lost ones from
Marshfielden?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What exactly is the ‘Light’?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know—I’ve tried to find out—but it is some
power of their own that they have learnt to control.
I think it is some force—something to do with the
natural light that pervades this place. It is sent
through the earth itself by the aid of some infernal
mechanism, and when it reaches the world above, it
attracts a victim which it strikes and brings back—a
living, sacrifice to this hell down here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a very terrible menace to our world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed it is! Some of the victims arrive mutilated
and burnt, and welcome the fire to deliver them from
their pains. In some miraculous way I was unhurt by
it—at least I was burnt very slightly, and soon
recovered. But, Alan! How did you get here? Did
the Light bring you too?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Desmond!” And Alan told the story of the
coal mine disaster and how he found the river that
brought him to his cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly their eyes met, and a quick flash passed
through their brains simultaneously. Alan was the first
to dispel it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s no good, Desmond, we couldn’t possibly
escape the way I came. We could not battle with
the current that brought me here. The water is
too deep to attempt to wade, and there isn’t so
much as a ledge on either side to which we could
cling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are we going to do then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course we must try and escape—but how? As
far as I can judge we must be somewhere near the
centre of the earth. How can we get implements to
cut our way back again—and even if we did, how long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>would it take us to do it? No, we are in a tough
position, and there isn’t even a telegraph pole or telephone
wire to aid us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their conversation was broken by the entrance of
Kaweeka. Unannounced and without deigning to
knock she entered the room, and both men rose to their
feet hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan stood with folded arms and a stern expression
upon his face. The moment’s madness of the yesterday
had passed. He knew the woman, siren, devil, call
her what you will, to be sensuous and foul—and his
passion had passed, leaving him firm in his strength and
with power to resist her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Like a serpent she glided up to them, and touched
them playfully on their cheeks, and then, ignoring
Desmond entirely, she held out her arms invitingly to
Alan. Sickened he turned away, but she came up
behind him, and put her arms about his neck. Brutally
he pulled them apart and flung her from him with a
very British “damn”—which, though the word might
be unintelligible to her, left the meaning clear and plain.
A look of fury, followed by one of malicious hatred,
passed over her features, and she turned abruptly from
Alan to Desmond, and in a low monotonous tone
crooned in her own language to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond fought against her powerful wiles for some
time, but he was frail, and her all pervading power drew
him nearer and nearer. Once more her arms were
open, and Desmond was drawn into them as a fish is
drawn into a net.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kaweeka gave a low chuckle, and turned in triumph
to Alan. With a half step forward he raised his hand
as though he would strike her, then drew back in time,
turned quickly and left them alone. Up and down the
outer room he paced and watched from the opening
the stream of purple people walking up and down the
street—men, women and children, all bent on work or
pleasure. In a way they seemed to be civilized, yet it
was a civilization unknown to the upper world. An
oppression came over him and he rushed to the door
and tried it. It was unlocked. That was more than he
had hoped for, and he hurried down the stairs to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>outer door. But there his progress was impeded, for
a sentry on guard drew a peculiar kind of spear and
prevented his passing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan cursed and swore at him, and then tried more
pacific measures to get his way; but the man was impervious
to everything, and Alan retraced his steps
and took refuge in a little alcove not far from the main
entrance. Suddenly a hand on his shoulder startled
him, and turning he saw Desmond looking at him in a
shamefaced manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We can go out, Kaweeka says,—at least that is what
I understand her to mean. Will you come now,
Lanny?”</p>

<p class='c012'>As he used the old boyish name, Alan felt a sob rise
in his throat and he grasped Desmond’s hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come on! old boy,” said he, “I want to talk to
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Kaweeka was standing near the door as they reached
it, and she waved to them to intimate they were free to
go out—but as they passed her they heard her issue a
command to the guard at the door who followed them,
and although they realized that he was for them a
protection among the wild people of the underworld,
yet it stripped them of all hope of ultimate
escape.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dez,” said Alan at last, “Do you love
Kaweeka?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Old chap, cut loose from her. When we get to
the world again—don’t let our stay down here have
coarsened us. The life is sordid enough, God knows,
but don’t let <i>us</i> be sordid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She has such power, Lanny.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know, Dez, but fight it down, boy, I’ll help
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks, old chap.” Then suddenly, “Do you
think we shall ever get away from here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I mean to have a try, how, when, or where I don’t
know yet, but there are two of us now and we must
fight hard for our freedom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose we really ought to try and gain the confidence
and trust of some of the natives?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“That won’t be easy, but we must make the most of
any opportunity that may come our way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then they lapsed into silence as they looked about
them in interest at the quaint places they passed. The
streets twisted and turned like a veritable maze, and
the boys wondered how the natives could ever remember
their way about. There were no shops to be seen—the
whole community seemed to live on roots that grew
abundantly everywhere, variegated fungi that grew in
clusters on low bushes by the water’s side, and fruits.
Fish too was eaten at times, but it seemed as if it was
only allowed to be consumed during certain periods
when religious festivals were being kept.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every home seemed to possess all the necessaries for
weaving the moss into garments for wear. There
was little difference in the men’s and women’s dress—a
tunic that was worn wide open at the breast and a
slightly shorter skirt on the male was all that
distinguished them, except of course, the training of
the hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>The families seemed to live in intense domestic happiness,
but jealousy made them suspicious of their neighbours,
and members of the bodyguard of the high priest
and Kaweeka were continually called in to check the
bickerings and quarrels that were always taking
place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan and Desmond walked on heedless of time; suddenly
their guard came up behind them, and in no
gentle manner intimated to them that it was time they
returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their life grew very monotonous, but they were
together—that was their only comfort. Kaweeka had
grown sullen and silent. She seemed to realize that
her uncanny power was useless now that Alan had
appeared on the scene, and she brooded over the slight
he had put upon her when he scorned her.</p>

<p class='c012'>They still lived in her house, but seldom saw her.
Food was brought them at regular intervals. Sometimes
days passed and they were not allowed to go out.
At other times Kaweeka would grow soft and gentle
and would send them out in her chariot, and they would
take their food and be away all day, wandering by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>underground rivers and lakes, or gathering fruits in
the quaint dwarf copses, where the tallest tree was not
more than four feet high.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time hung very heavily on their hands, and there
seemed no hope of their ever being able to extricate
themselves from their terrible position.</p>

<p class='c012'>They learnt to weave the moss into tunics for
themselves, and they made mats and rugs for their
apartments. Grasses they plaited into belts—and
that constituted the whole of their amusement and
work.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their personal guard, Wolta, was a particularly fierce
individual, who had never recovered from his violent
dislike of the white strangers. What services he did
for them he did grudgingly, and their food was often
ill-served and spoiled through his spite.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came the day when a new man appeared to wait
on them. They could not understand what he said, but
Okwa intimated to them that they were to follow him.
He led them down to the lower floor and out into a
courtyard behind the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>There in a rude coffin, fashioned of cloth stretched on
poles, lay Wolta—dead. The boys watched in interest,
for this was the first death they had seen since they had
been in the underworld.</p>

<p class='c012'>No cover was placed over the dead man, no religious
ceremony was held over the inanimate form. The
coffin and its burden was carried down the dark street
by two bearers. On they went until they came to a
dark lake whose waters were black and evil-looking.
Without any ceremony the body was pitched out into
the water. It floated eerily for a few minutes, the eyes
open wide and the mouth contorted into a grin. Then
there was the sound of a splash and a large head
appeared, followed by another and another. There was
the snapping of teeth and the sound of closing jaws—and
an ominous purple stain floated on the top of the
lake.</p>

<p class='c012'>The boys turned away sick at heart from the horrible
sight—and when they did look again—all trace of
Wolta had vanished—there remained only the same stain
on the bosom of the water. The two bearers calmly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>folded up the collapsible coffin and slung it across their
shoulders;—it was quite ready for the next victim that
death might claim.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s horrible,” said Desmond with a shudder. “I
wonder whether they give all their dead to those filthy
man-eating fish?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should think so,” answered Alan. “Their idea
of burial seems worse than some of the rites of the
South Sea Islanders.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their days passed in sickening monotony, and their
lungs ached for fresh air and salt breezes. They spoke
to no one, saw no one but Okwa, and they were getting
into such a state of nerves, they could hardly converse
sanely one with the other. Okwa came in one day and
intimated that they could go out. Moodily they walked
down the streets and made their way to a river near
by—a guard, as usual, following close behind. They
sat down on the steep mossy banks that led to the
water’s edge; depressed and wretched they remained
moody and silent. Suddenly there came the sound of
a scuffle behind them—a startled cry and a splash. A
little girl had stumbled, and rolling down the slippery
bank was struggling in the water. The current was
very strong, and the little maid, swimmer though she
was, was unable to battle with the rapids. Twice her
head had disappeared from sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a second Alan was in the river after her, and
diving down, brought her to the surface; but the whirlpools
were strong and treacherous and the water deep,
and it was only with the greatest difficulty that he
succeeded in reaching the bank, where Desmond was
waiting, in whose arms he placed the now unconscious
child. But the strain he had undergone proved almost
too much for him, and even as he saw the child into
safety, he slipped back into the river and the boiling
waters closed over his head. He rose again to the
surface and with an almost superhuman effort clung to
the bank, and Desmond and their guard pulled him
ashore.</p>

<p class='c012'>His first thought was for the child who was lying
seemingly lifeless on the ground. He knew the
elements of first aid, and vigorously moved her little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>arms above her head, and then pressed them well
against her ribs. Gradually the air was pumped into
her lungs, she opened her eyes, smiled, and in a very
few moments afterwards was able to stand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, run along, little one,” said Alan, kindly—but
the child put her lips to his and clung to him, and
he had perforce to hoist her to his shoulder and march
home with her, ensconced there happily like a little
queen. The guard prostrated himself before them, and
bowed and kissed the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve made a conquest,” laughed Desmond. “I
wonder who she is.” As they neared the precincts
of the city they heard the clashing of cymbals and the
beating of drums. A religious procession was in progress.
Alan and Desmond stepped aside to allow it to
pass. A long column of veiled temple virgins led the
way, followed by priests and acolytes and tiny children,
consecrated at birth to the temple, who scattered leaves
on the ground. Then an aged patriarch hove in sight,
borne on a litter with a canopy of gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little girl became excited. “Abbi! Abbi!”
she shrieked, and wriggled to get free from her throne
on Alan’s shoulder. The priest’s face grew livid. He
uttered a cry of rage and gave a swift command to
two attendants by his side. Instantly the symmetry
of the procession was broken, and Alan and Desmond
were bound with rope and dragged away.
It was all done so quickly that they had no time to
resist.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little girl had watched the scene with wondering
eyes, and when she realized the whole purport, flung
herself into Alan’s arms. The priest issued another
quick command, and with the little one holding fast to
her rescuer’s hand, she obviously told the story of her
escape.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she had finished the priest kissed her tenderly,
and then knelt low before the two boys and kissed their
feet. Then they were given places in a litter behind
the high priests and were taken to the temple—this
time as honoured guests.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were led to the altar, and very suspiciously and
timidly seated themselves on the steps, one on either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>side, which the high priest indicated to them. The
ceremonial service was very long and tedious, but was
unaccompanied by any sacrificial rites, much to the satisfaction
of the two boys.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the priest stood facing the people, and held out
a hand to each of the boys who stood shamefaced and
awkwardly beside him. There followed an address, and
the boys knew it was the story being told to the people
of the rescue by Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the priest had finished speaking, he bent down
and kissed their hands, and wildly the congregation
flocked to the altar rail to follow his example. They
were accepted by the whole community as friends.
Their lives were no longer in jeopardy. Then the boys
resumed their seats and the ceremony of the temple was
concluded.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the service Alan’s eyes were riveted on some
peculiar characters that were inscribed on the walls, at
intervals, as far as eye could reach. It was a group of
hieroglyphics repeated over and over again, and there
was something oddly familiar about them—yet he was
unable to guess exactly what it was. Then the people’s
voice rose in song—he listened intently. Again and
again were the words repeated like a chorus and
almost unconsciously he committed the sounds to
memory.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon the service was ended and in triumph they were
led back to Kaweeka’s house. She met them with
renewed wiles and charm, but the boys were strong and
she left them alone with rage in her heart. They ate
the food that was placed before them in silence, a
silence which Alan broke by saying abruptly, “Could
you make out anything of the last hymn the people kept
singing over and over again in the temple, Dez?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, could you understand it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond looked surprised. “Of course not,” he
laughed. “Could you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan did not answer the question, but asked another.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, they sung it over a good many times—didn’t
you memorize the sounds?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Desmond thought a minute, “I think I did,” he
replied. “It sounded something like:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Har-Ju-Jar! Har-Ju-Jar! Kar-Tharn.</i>”</div>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Har-Ju-Jar! Har-Ju-Jar! Kar-Tharn.</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Alan pulled a scrap of paper triumphantly out of his
pocket and showed it to his cousin. He had written
down the exact phonetic spelling of the words Desmond
had said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the same, I don’t see what you are driving at,”
he demurred, “you look confoundedly pleased over
something.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve been working out a theory, and I don’t think
I am far wrong in the decision I have arrived at. Now
look at that,” and he handed him another piece of
paper on which were written the following signs:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_075a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>Desmond looked at it quizzically for a moment, and
then said, “Why, you’ve copied down the signs that are
painted all around the walls of the temple—in the great
Fire Hall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right. Now can you translate it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond laughed. “Of course not. Can you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think so,” said Alan confidently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What?” almost shouted Desmond in amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” went on Alan. “You got your first in
Theology at Cambridge—translate this”—and he
passed Desmond a third slip of paper with other signs
on it:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_075b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>Desmond looked at it carefully. “I’ve almost forgotten,”
he commenced. Then—“why it’s Hebrew—Hebrew
for Abiram and Dathan!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Now I want you to think carefully, Dez,” and Alan
placed the two slips of paper on which were written the
characters, before him. “Now would you not swear that
<i>this</i>,” pointing to the characters copied from the temple,
“is a corruption of <i>that</i>?”—pointing to the Hebrew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well it certainly looks as if it might easily be so,”
admitted Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now think of the few words we picked up of that
hymn to-day. Isn’t it within the bounds of possibility
that Har-ju-jar is a corruption of Hallelujah, or
Alleluia?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ye-e-es.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Har-Barim and Kar-Tharn a corruption of
Abiram and Dathan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ye-es.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” concluded Alan triumphantly, “this is the
conclusion I have come to. The language of these
people is a corruption of Hebrew.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m certain of it, and I am surprised we never
thought of it before. Of course it was our first visit to
the temple to-day since I came here, and I never noticed
those signs before—but to-day as I looked at them they
seemed oddly familiar, and it suddenly dawned on me
in a flash. Now we ought to find it very easy to pick
up the patois they speak—we both used to know something
of Hebrew in the old days at college.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were almost too excited to say much more,
when suddenly Alan brought his hand down on the
table with a bang that made Desmond start.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve got it, Dez old boy,” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Got what?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why think of your Bible. In the—let me see—oh
never mind—somewhere in Numbers, I think, we get
the story of Korah, Abiram and Dathan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh my dear Alan, I am afraid I have forgotten it
long ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind,” went on Alan excitedly. “It’s the
sixteenth chapter, if I remember rightly. I’ll remind
you of it—Don’t you remember the Chosen People rose
up against Moses—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“I can’t remember the exact verses but somewhere
in the chapter it tells you that the ‘earth was torn
asunder, and swallowed up the three men with their
houses and everything that appertained unto them, and
they went down <i>alive</i> into the pit, and the earth closed
over them.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond looked bewildered and remained silent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you see the connection, Dez?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! I do not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, here are people living in the bowels of the
earth, and in their temple they have inscribed in bad
Hebrew, if I may so put it, the names of Abiram and
Dathan. What more likely than that these people are
the descendants of those poor unfortunates of the Old
Testament who perished some fourteen hundred and
ninety years before Christ?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it possible?” asked Desmond breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not?” answered his cousin. “The Bible
story ends there. We’re simply told that they went
into the pit <i>alive</i>—we are never told that they died!
Now we are convinced that they speak a corrupt
Hebrew, we ought to find it very easy to learn to speak
to them, and then we will bid for freedom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alan,” said Desmond suddenly. “I wonder
whether your theory is correct. We’ve got Abiram
and Dathan right enough, but what about Korah? He
was the chief offender and yet there is no trace of his
name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I expect his name has been lost during the transit
of time,” said Alan. “At any rate I am tired now, and
I shan’t bother any more about it for the present.
Let’s go to sleep,” and the two boys went into their
inner chamber and were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no night in this terrible underworld; the
purple lights never went out; morning and evening were
unknown. The place was never plunged into entire
darkness—true, the inhabitants went to sleep, but they
pleased themselves as to when they slept and for how
long. The whole world was never at rest at the
same time—truly, indeed, it was an unholy place of
unrest!</p>

<p class='c012'>The two men were fast asleep, the purple light shining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>across their, faces, and Alan moved restlessly, for his
dreams were troubled ones.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly the door opened gently and a figure
appeared—it was Kaweeka. Softly she crept across
their room, and halted by the side of their couches. A
fierce light came into her eyes as she watched the
rhythmic rise and fall of Alan’s chest as he breathed
heavily. She bent over him, kissed his lips, and murmured
savagely as she did so—</p>

<p class='c012'>“So desired—so desirable—yet I so undesired!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>RELATING TO HISTORY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“How long have we been down here, Lanny?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Together do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh months and months—I can’t count time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Neither can I. Days pass—we grow tired and we
sleep, only to wake to another day like the last, like
every day here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How far have you got with the translation, Dez?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nearly to the end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Splendid. What do you make of it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just what we expected—It is a very corrupted
version of part of the Pentateuch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much of it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nearly all Genesis—a minute portion of Exodus—and
Leviticus.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan gave a satisfied sigh. “That’s splendid,” he
remarked. Many months had passed since they had
made the discovery that the language of the underworld
was a patois Hebrew, and quickly and diligently
they set to work to learn it. They first spelt the sounds
and wrote them down, and then tried to translate them
into Hebrew where it was at all possible.</p>

<p class='c012'>Very shortly after the rescue of the high priest’s
daughter and only child, as the maid proved to be, a
house was placed at the boys’ disposal, and they gladly
left the protection of Kaweeka, and lived together with
a couple of servants, who looked after them. They
were free to go out among the people, and they began
to feel almost happy. With the aid of a few words
they picked up they asked the high priest for “reading”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and he had given them copies of the “Kadetha”
which proved to be the Bible of these strange people.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was very difficult to read as it was written on
parchment in a purple ink that had faded considerably
through time. The characters, too, besides being
different from the Hebrew they knew, were written
from top to bottom of the page instead of from right
to left, as are most Asiatic languages.</p>

<p class='c012'>From what they could gather the “Kadetha” was
divided into two parts—the Moiltee—which proved to
be part of the first three books of Moses—and
“Jarcobbi,” five books written by one of the first
priests of the people after their descent into the bowels
of the earth. That these strange people were really
descendants of the rebels against Moses, the boys had
not the slightest shadow of doubt—the proof in the
“Kadetha” was only too conclusive. They were
now able to converse fairly freely with the people,
and were able to understand many of their strange
beliefs.</p>

<p class='c012'>The true meaning of the Light they were so far
unable to fathom, but “Har-Barim” the high priest,
told them there would be no more offerings to the Fire
from “Above” as he called the world. The people
began to take more kindly to them, but Kaweeka
remained watchful and brooding, and they realized that
she was indeed a bitter enemy, and the person most
greatly to be feared in the underworld. Little
Myruum, the high priest’s daughter, spent many hours
with them, and they learnt much of the language from
her baby prattle.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were admitted to all the services and religious
rites in the temple, and the boys noted with surprise
that the fire seemed to be daily losing its power. Its
flames grew smaller and smaller, and they noticed the
difference in it when they had not seen it for several
days.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jovah,” they said to Har-Barim one day. “Tell
us your history, now we understand your language.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The old man smiled at them. “There is little to
tell,” he said. “It is true we were once of the earth
above—once white people like yourselves; but for over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>three thousand, three hundred and three years we have
lived in the darkness of the earth. Our skins are
changed—they have taken the hue of the land we are
forced to dwell in. Our forefathers burrowed in the
earth to make streets and houses and shelter for their
families, and they left us the heritage of their labour.”
He pointed as he spoke to the short horn that protruded
from his forehead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What became of Korah?” they asked him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Coorer?” he pronounced the word differently.
“Korah,” he told them, was their bad angel. It was
Korah, with the devil in his soul who urged them to
stand up against Moses, and it was Korah they shut
away from their lives when the pit had closed in upon
them, revealing to them no more the light of the
sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you mean?” asked Alan. “How did you
shut him out of your lives, my Jovah?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jovah signified “Father” and was the term by which
all the people addressed Har-Barim.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, my sons, when the pit closed down upon our
forefathers, all turned upon Korah as the father of all
their woes. He was stoned and left half dead—then
a wall was built up in front of him and all his family,
together with all his possessions, and there he was left
to perish. One of his daughters escaped, however, and
her descendants have been Princesses of Kalvar, as we
call our country, ever since.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then Kaweeka—” began Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my son. In Kaweeka you see the Princess of
Kalvar, and direct descendant in the female line of the
unfortunate Korah himself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Korah’s burial place?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>Har-Barim shook his head. “No one knows—in the
generations of time that have passed the secret has been
lost, and the exact position forgotten. No one knows—no
one ever will know, until—but there, read from
the fourteenth line of the sixth part of our prophet,
Zurishadeel,” and taking a small parchment from his
voluminous pocket he handed it to Alan and left them
to translate it for themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Laboriously they copied out the translation—</p>

<p class='c017'>“For the body of Korah the devil is hidden with
those of his household. Their flesh shall rot
and their bones become powder, and in a
generation their last resting place shall be
forgotten. But on the day the secret is no more—for
behold a virgin shall in a dream learn the
way—the fire shall consume quickly, strange
people shall enter the land of Kalvar, and
desolation and destruction shall come to all
those that inhabit the earth. Yea, the people
that are in the belly of it, and they that
have been disgorged from it—when the Fire
grows less—when the Tomb of Korah is found
then shall all in due time perish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cheery old chap, isn’t he?” laughed Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Alan was thoughtful. “I wonder what the
secret of the fire is. They seem to worship it, although
they pray to the ‘Lord of their Fathers.’ It certainly
is getting less—I can’t help feeling that something
terrible will happen if it does ever go out entirely.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For some time they gazed meditatively at the translations
they had made when a shadow crossing Desmond’s
paper made him look up. It was Kaweeka—Kaweeka
who had not visited them for months it
seemed, and whose presence now seemed to denote
some evil. Quietly she watched them for a few
minutes, and a curious light came into her eyes. They
glittered and shone with an almost fanatical glow—and
in fact her whole being was one of suppressed
excitement and almost maniacal fervour.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come,” said she at last, and held out a hand to
each. They felt impelled to obey her, and she led them
straight to the temple which was curiously deserted.
The great fire was burning in fits and starts. Suddenly
a flaming tongue would leap out, blazing brightly
as if refusing to be killed, and a moment later it would
lie dead and dormant among the embers. Then
suddenly the fire would emit a passion of sparks which
flew upward in a fury, only to fall back within its folds,
dull and lifeless.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was still enormous of course, but the boys realized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>that its life was nearing the end, and that its power was
nearly gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kaweeka suddenly turned on Desmond and in a whirl
of passion addressed him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Desmond,” she cried, “I loved you—I would have
made you happy, but he”—pointing to Alan—“he
came between us. He tore my heart from its resting
place within my breast—he made me love him also, and
then stamped on my love and spurned me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is hardly fair, Kaweeka. I never made overtures
to you—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Desmond, doing his best to conciliate
her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Enough,” she cried and then began a frenzied
tirade to which the boys listened in horror, as they
realized that almost a madness had come upon Kaweeka—the
seed of Korah.</p>

<p class='c012'>Falling to her knees she clung to Alan and begged
him to marry her according to the custom of his world
and hers. She offered to make him Prince of the land
of Kalvar and possessor of a thousand fortunes if he
would but love her—be it ever so little. And when he
gently lifted her up and put her away from him, she
looked him fully in the eyes, and for a full minute there
was silence. Then with a queer gesture of finality, she
outspread her hands and accepted the inevitable. Then
in a monotonous voice and with carefully chosen words
she began to speak again—</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the world you came from, O Men of the Sun,
you saw strange sights and heard strange things. A
light appeared in the sky—a light that was the forerunner
of tragedy. I propose to show you the Light,
O Strangers. I will unfold the secret of its being
before your wondering eyes. Know you now, that
this Fire is next in honour to the God of our Fathers.
It is the Fire that gives us air to breathe, and light by
which we can see. From the Fire we obtain our
strength, and when it dies out our power will be gone.
But know you also, that when our Fire dies and we
perish, so will your world die also. You above are
dependent for your very existence on the Fire in the
Earth’s belly—with our extinction will come also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>consummation of all mankind. See”—and she pointed
to a coil of metal that looked like a silver rope—“See—this
is the Light—the Light that brought sacrifices
we could offer to our God of all, and that fed our
Fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then she began a weird dance. Grovelling on the
floor in apparent worship of the Fire, she drew nearer
and nearer to the shimmering metal, and taking up one
end of it, undid it until it lay in shimmering folds outspread
upon the floor. Still, with rhythmic grace, she
continued, now advancing, now retreating, until she
had coiled part of the writhing mass about her body,
and the boys realized that one end was firmly embedded
in the heart of the Fire itself. And as they watched
they realized that Kaweeka was dancing away from the
Fire—away down the length of the great Fire Hall, to
where a little door was half hidden behind cherubim
of gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>The boys felt impelled to follow the strange witch
woman. Through the little door, they went, down a
dark passage which ended suddenly in a small chamber
that was bright with light. But the whole of the cave-like
place vibrated and shook with a force that was
terrifying in its magnitude. They looked around
curiously and saw in one corner a large clock-like
instrument from which the sound came.</p>

<p class='c012'>With almost loving care Kaweeka freed herself from
the shimmering metal and placed the end of it in the
machine. Instantly they saw it gain in strength and
brightness—it seemed to quicken and show signs of
life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two boys gave a cry—“The Light! The
Light!” they cried, for this indeed was the mysterious
Light that had stricken Marshfielden, and now they
were seeing its wondrous power from below.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kaweeka leaned over the burning metal, and touched
a lever on the clock-like instrument’s face. Suddenly
with a roar and a flash, the Light soared upwards.
Through the roof of the cave—onwards—onwards—forcing
an outlet for itself by its own power, through
rock and earth it tore,—until the watching eyes of the
boys were rewarded by a speck of blue. “The sky!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>cried Desmond in amazement. The Light had once
more visited the outer world! This then was the
horror of Marshfielden!</p>

<p class='c012'>The boys watched the quivering metal in silence. In
its deadly folds it had embraced Dan Murlock’s baby.
Mr. Winthrop had suffered from its caress. Mrs. Skeet—Mrs.
Slater—it was impossible to name all the victims
of its diabolical power. Some element, mightier even
than electricity, had been discovered by these purple
savages, to be used by them only for the purpose of
destruction.</p>

<p class='c012'>Long the boys watched until their eyes ached from
the intense brightness. Their hearts were heavy
within them as they thought of the victim it might
bring back. Kaweeka sat in one corner mumbling and
muttering to herself, and the boys seemed powerless
to leave the place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Voices rose in song—cymbals clashed—drums rolled—the
evening service was being held in the temple.
Still they waited! The sounds died away and the
temple emptied, yet the Light had not returned.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were growing cramped, their limbs ached, and
then the Light trembled more violently than before.
The vision of the sky grew clearer for an instant; they
knew the Light was returning—but it was not returning
alone! Rigid in every muscle the boys waited as it
travelled through the bowels of the Earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>The heap of metal grew larger on the floor as it made
its descent—then the end appeared in sight—a sheep,
burnt and dead, was within its grasp. Silently Kaweeka
came forward and touched a lever on the vibrating
clock in the corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>The noise ceased. The Light grew shadowed. The
aperture leading to the world above closed, leaving
only a scar to mark where it had been!</p>

<p class='c012'>Kaweeka bent over the stricken sheep and unwound
the Light from its body, leaving exposed the singed
wool and burnt flesh, and as if it had been a child
gathered it up in her arms and still holding to the end
of the Light danced back into the empty temple.</p>

<p class='c012'>Without an effort she tossed the dead sheep into the
Fire, and the flames devoured it savagely. Then she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>began again her wild dance and gradually wound the
Light up into its original coils until it lay in a heap by
the side of the Fire. “According to the prophecy of
Zurishadele I speak. Behold, he writes ‘Whosoever
shall cause the seed of Korah to die shall be hunted
by the people of Kalvar—yea until their blood gushes
forth through their eyes and they are blind—until their
limbs crumple up beneath them and they fall—so shall
they be hunted that the people of Kalvar may deliver
them up to the Fire.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kaweeka smiled evilly. “It is true I am of the seed
of Korah, and you, my Alan, have scorned me. I have
given you my love—I would give you all—but you have
laughed at me and mocked me. I would have given
you my body—but now I give you more—I will give
you my life. The Fire is burning low—more fuel is
needed to keep it alive. I will give myself for fuel—but
in giving my life, I offer two more to the God of
our Fathers. For as you are the instrument of my
destruction—so will the people fall upon you, and
through the mouth of Mzata the Great, will you be
offered a sacrifice to the Fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Lightly, gracefully, she stepped onto the transparent
wall that surrounded the Fire, and then with a piercing
cry tore off her jewels and her raiment and flung them
into the flames, that were waiting eagerly for the food
that was offered them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, naked, her hair falling about her, her dark skin
shimmering in the light, she flung herself into the centre
of the Fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan rushed forward, but it was too late—the cruel
tongues of fire had wrapped round her, and all that was
left of the seed of Korah was a skull, stripped of its
flesh, grinning at them for an instant through the
flames, before it disappeared.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was all so unexpected, so sudden, that the boys
had not realized what she purposed doing, and now,
speechless and bewildered, they stared at each other in
horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly a hoarse whisper broke through the silence.
“Flee, flee,” it said, and they recognized the voice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Har-Barim. “I cannot save you,” he continued.
“My people will fall upon you and slay you—for
although they loved not Kaweeka, yet the prophecy
will have to be fulfilled. To-day is the vigil of the feast
of Meherut—to-morrow the great feast itself. Till then
and then only can I hide the manner of Kaweeka’s
death. As you saved my Myruum, so will I try to save
you. This much can I tell you. Make for the waters
that are turbulent and wild, where they narrow to the
space of a foot and dash against a rocky wall. Look
for the stones that are red.—Now—go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But where shall we go?” cried Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take always the centre path, my son, and avoid
the waters that are tranquil and smooth. The way is
rough—thy path must of a surety be rough also, but
with courage victory will come to you. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Har-Barim left them alone in the temple.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quickly they made their way to their house, there was
no time to be lost. Plans had to be made and made
quickly. Once more they were in a strange land, where
through no fault of their own, hostility and enmity
would meet them once more.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>OUT INTO THE GREAT BEYOND</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The boys had no packing to do. They possessed
nothing but the clothes they stood in, and a sailor’s
clasp knife that belonged to Alan; but they put together
a store of dried elers, a fruit that was sustaining, and
that, down below, took the place of the bread of the
upper world.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were very few of the purple people about; it
was the vigil of Meherut,—the most solemn feast day
of their strange religion, and all were shut up in their
houses with their curtains drawn spending their time in
fasting and prayer.</p>

<p class='c012'>On, on the boys went, always choosing the middle
path if a choice was offered them, if not, then taking
the path to the right. Gradually they left all sign of
habitation and entered a most desolate region where
the purple moss grew only in patches, and the purple
lights were only few and far between. They stumbled
on blindly; they dared not wait for food; every moment
was precious to them. Suddenly Desmond stumbled
and fell. “I can’t go a step further,” he cried.
“How long have we been walking, Lanny?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“About ten hours I should think.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then for Heaven’s sake let us rest! We have a
fair start of them—let us rest and have some food.”
The elers refreshed them, and they drank of the water
that rolled treacherously at their feet. It was not very
wide, perhaps three feet at the most, but the current
was strong and the whirlpools more torrential than
ever.</p>

<p class='c012'>Stretching themselves out on the ground the boys
slept, and woke some five or six hours later feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>greatly refreshed. Then they continued their march,
now leaving the river behind them, now coming upon
it again and walking by its banks.</p>

<p class='c012'>They had no idea of where they were going.
They had only one goal in view—to put as big a
distance as they could between themselves and the
purple people whom they knew would already be
following them. Suddenly the road ended. They had
turned a sharp corner and the way had opened out into
a small cave, which was bounded on one side by a
narrow strip of bubbling, foaming water, that disappeared
at either end in a dark tunnel. “What shall
we do?” asked Desmond. “Shall we go back?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We can’t,” said Alan decisively. “The road that
brought us here was at least five miles long, without a
turn in it. By the time we retraced our steps, the
purple devils would have caught up to us. No, old
boy, I think this is a tight fix we are in, and at the
moment I can’t quite see how we are to get out of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They walked round the little cave examining it carefully.
It had only the one exit—the path up which
they had come. The tunnels at either end through
which flowed the waters were too low to admit the
passage of a body, and the walls on the other side of
the little river rose sheer from the water itself. “It
looks pretty hopeless,” said Alan at last, “but at all
costs we must not go back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How red the walls are,” said Desmond suddenly.
Alan started, for in his mind he could hear a voice saying,
“Look for the stones that are red.” It had been
Har-Barim’s advice to them, and he had said—“make
for the waters that are turbulent and wild—where in
the space of a foot—” A foot! why the water couldn’t
be wider than that here. He looked round hurriedly—was
it his fancy or were the stones on the opposite side
even redder than those about him?</p>

<p class='c012'>To Alan’s strained nerves it seemed as if just opposite
him a stone had been worn away by the constant
passage of feet. Slowly a thought came into his mind—if
that was a footprint then surely it must lead somewhere.
His eyes travelled up the rock eagerly—again
his quickened senses discovered another foothold a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>higher up, and still another and another. Four in all,
at perhaps a stretch of a little over two feet. Upward
his glance wandered, and in the rugged rock he saw a
flat piece of red stone that looked as if it had been
inserted there at some time or other, for some specific
purpose. He stretched across the raging torrent and
with a mighty effort clung to the jagged rock. “Don’t
touch me, Dez,” he commanded, “I think I can manage
best alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With an almost superhuman effort he placed his foot
in the first little cleft, and gradually worked up to the
little red stone that had so aroused his curiosity.
Desmond watched him in breathless horror. Although
the water was so narrow, Alan would stand little chance
of saving himself if he fell in, for it was dashing wildly
against the sides and sending its spray even higher than
where Alan was clinging. He touched the stone—it
moved ever so slightly. “God! A secret way!” he
cried, and worked feverishly to open it. But although
it trembled and shook, it would not disclose its secret.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, away in the distance, came the sound of fierce
shouting and the beating of drums.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The people know,” cried Desmond. “They are
coming up the long passage.” Already they could
hear the name of Kaweeka used as a battle cry, and
they realized that they could expect little mercy if they
were caught by the purple savages.</p>

<p class='c012'>With beads of perspiration on his brow, Alan worked.
His fingers were torn and bleeding from his exertions.
Still nearer came the cries of the infuriated people, and
Alan had not yet succeeded in moving the stone, which
he was convinced hid a secret way of escape. Desmond
ran down the passage a little way—in a second he was
back. “I can see them,” he cried. “There are
hundreds of them! Oh, what shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah!” Alan gave a cry of relief, for suddenly the
stone had rolled back, revealing a small cavity beyond,
just big enough for the passage of a man’s body.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Follow me in, Dez,” he cried, “no matter where it
leads—it can’t be worse than if we remain here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their pursuers were now in full view, and if seemed
that only a few yards separated them. Quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Desmond climbed the steps and reached the hole, and
Alan drew him in, and even as he turned to make fast
the opening, a head with an evil-looking horn appeared.
Alan doubled his fist and gave a mighty blow, and like
a log the man dropped into the water, was sucked under
and carried out of sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>They rolled the stone back into its place, and panting,
leant against it. The execrations and cries of the
natives came faintly on their ears; the great stone
trembled, and they knew it was being forced from
without. One hurried glance round revealed to them
great boulders of rock lying on the ground. Feverishly
they piled them up in front of the stone, and they were
strong enough to resist the furious onslaught that the
purple people kept up. After a time, the cries of the
people grew fainter, gradually they died away
altogether, and the underworld folk made their way
back to the temple to pray that the white men might be
handed over to them, and that they might be allowed
to punish the slayers of the seed of Korah.</p>

<p class='c012'>Spent and tired the two boys sank to the ground, for
many hours had passed while they were defending their
retreat from the underworld people. A faint, natural,
ground light shone around. It was like the same
purple light that lit the whole of the underworld, but
here it was in its natural condition, and was so faint
that it scarcely showed them each other’s face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go to sleep, Dez,” said Alan. “I will keep
watch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you are tired too,” demurred his cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan smiled. “Sleep first, old man,” said he, and
even as he spoke, Desmond dropped his head upon his
breast, and his eyes closed in slumber.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a great strain for Alan to sit there in the
darkness—in a weird and unknown place—soundless
except for Desmond’s heavy, regular breathing. His
own breath seemed to his quickened senses like the
blast of heavy artillery, and the slightest sound was
magnified a hundredfold. Nobly he fought against
sleep—but he was worn out, and at last his eyes closed—and
he too, slept.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time meant nothing to these imprisoned men.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Science they could laugh at, for, from a scientific point
of view, their very life was impossible. How in the
centre of the earth could mankind live? Yet it was
true they had lived, fed, and breathed for months and
months in the very belly of the earth. Science said the
centre of the earth was impenetrable—that the intense
heat of its inner fire would prevent man even seeing that
fire. Yet they could prove that they had seen and they
could tell the scientists that the fire was waning.</p>

<p class='c012'>Still they slept.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fantastic dreams came into their minds, yet there
was not so much as the scuffling of a rat or the squeaking
of a mouse to awaken them. All was silent and
still, with a stillness that cannot be expressed by words.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond woke first—the light did not seem so dim—or
had they become used to it? His eyes rested on
Alan sleeping soundly by his side, and a tear dropped
on his cousin’s brow as he leant over him. It was a
tear not to be laughed at, nor to be ashamed of, but the
tear of a strong man shed in the bitterness of his
oppression.</p>

<p class='c012'>He rose to his feet, stretched his limbs, and wandered
round the place where he found himself. It was a
cavern, very similar to the numberless others he had
passed through on the further side of the rapid river.
Its floor was rugged, but was covered with the purple
moss, and a few bushes which bore fruit were growing
there. Round and round he walked, but the cave
seemed to have no outlet at all. Alan woke and
watched Desmond in silence for a short while, and then
said, “Don’t worry, Dez, I’m sure we shall find a way
out. This must lead somewhere.” But although he
too, examined the cave very carefully, there seemed to
be no outlet.</p>

<p class='c012'>How long they stayed there they did not know—fortunately
they found some roots which were edible,
and whose long bulb-like ends were filled with a
pleasant fluid which quenched their thirst. They played
games with each other, did everything in fact to prevent
the madness they were afraid would come over them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nearer and nearer it crept like a beast of prey waiting
to spring and devour his victims. With their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>forced inactivity their limbs became cramped and
although the air was pure, their lips were dry and their
throats parched. They began to give up speaking
aloud; they would sit for hours in silence, only uttering
occasionally a croaking whisper, one to the other, as if
they were afraid of being overheard. Then the day—but
no, it cannot be called that—the time came when
Desmond lay quiet and still, and Alan awoke to the
consciousness that something was radically wrong with
his cousin. He bent over the inanimate figure, and
touched him gently with his hand. The eyes were
closed and the fists clenched and had he been able to
see clearly, he would have noticed the purple lines round
the cold mouth, and a pinched look upon the face, that
boded nought but ill.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must do something,” he muttered wearily, and
then he burst out into a paroxysm of weeping. That
saved his life, for when he came to himself it was as a
fresh man.</p>

<p class='c012'>Plucking some of the purple foliage, he squeezed the
stalks and let the cool liquid pour gently on Desmond’s
brow, then tenderly chiding and imploring him, he
managed to bring back a sign of life to his cousin’s
face. Nor did he stop then, but continued, until
Desmond woke to reason and called him by his name.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Desmond had fallen into a refreshed and tranquil
sleep, Alan wandered round and round the little
cave, looking still for some weak spot.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly there came a sound in the distance—a thud
that shook the very ground upon which he was standing.
With every nerve wound up to concert pitch
he waited—listening intently to see if he could hear
again the sudden sound that had broken the stillness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s my fancy,” said he aloud, but even as he spoke
the noise began again with greater fury. The cavern
shook—pieces of rock came hurtling down, broken off
from their parent wall by the vibrations. Then suddenly
came a sound almost like an explosion, and a
piece of rock, larger than the rest came tumbling down,
and revealed behind it a small passage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dez.” cried Alan. “Dez, a way of escape has
come.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Desmond opened his eyes and looked round vacantly,
and indeed it was some time before he realized the
wonderful thing that had happened.</p>

<p class='c012'>The underworld folk had made one last mighty effort
to reach them, and the boys could have gone down on
their knees to thank the purple people, for their
machinations had given them hope once more.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>A FRIEND FROM THE ENEMY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Desmond, still weak, raised himself up, and looked
about him; and even as he did so, a huge boulder fell
from the blocked secret entrance that led to the city of
the underworld.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are bombarding the place,” said Alan looking
startled, “let us go through there,” and he pointed
to the little passage that had been revealed to them so
strangely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We can blockade it from the other side,” said
Desmond, “and at least it will give us more time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A close examination revealed to them a hinged slab of
stone that swung easily to and fro, and the spring that
fastened it in place was plain to see on the inner side.
They crept into the passage, closed the stone after them,
and piled rocks and stones in front of it as an extra
protection. Again came a weary time of waiting—a
time when the cave was filled with wild laughter and
hideous ravings—when the furies of Hell itself seemed
let loose on the other side. The purple fiends had
forced an entrance, but too late. Their prey had
escaped them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan and Desmond lay and listened to the babel of
their voices, for strangely enough the slightest sound
from the other cave was magnified in this inner one.
Then a silence fell, and they realized that the purple
savages had once more gone. Hungrily they
gathered roots and ate them greedily—when a woman’s
cry, clear and distinct, startled them. Again and again
it came—“Ar-lane! Jez-mun!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their names were called in the quaint pronunciation
of the underworld folk.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“Who is it?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll see.”—</p>

<p class='c012'>“No don’t go—don’t go—it’s some trick—” but
Alan had already pulled down the stones in front of
the hinged stone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ar-lane. Jez-mun.” Again the cry came.
“Open—open I beg. I come to aid you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to speak to her,” said Alan grimly, and
he put his lips close against the stone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who are you and what do you want of us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>A glad cry was his answer, and then followed quickly—“Let
me through, O Ar-lane—I have come to seek
thee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you want of us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen, O Ar-lane, I have fled from my home in
the temple of Fire, and have come to thee. Years ago
when a tiny child, I found the cavern and knew it well.
But Am-rab the Wise, my tutor and priest, forbade me
with threats of torture to wander there again. Since
then I have not set eyes upon the place. Let me in,
O Ar-lane, for the spring is broken on this side, and I
cannot find it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond was listening suspiciously. “What are you
going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>And again came the pleading voice. “Let me in, O
Ar-lane. Oh, let me in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked questioningly at Desmond and he gave
his cousin a quick nod. “If it’s treachery we’re
done,” he remarked, as he touched the spring and the
stone moved.</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as it was wide open the woman entered.
They did not know her, but her eyes were swollen from
weeping and her face drawn with emotion, and they
realized that she had suffered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Waste no time,” she commanded imperiously.
“My flight is already spoken of in the temple. Should
they seek me, it will need all our strength, all our
cunning to hide from them. Close the door, O Ar-lane,
and build up a wall of stones in front, that is strong,
and then let us hasten on.” So once more the place
was barricaded, and only when the barrier was complete
did she deign to explain her presence.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“You know me not, O Men of the Upper World,
for you have never set eyes upon me before; but I have
seen you often. Behold, I am Jez-Riah, seed of the
house of Bin-Nab, and hereditary Keeper of the Hall
of Fire. It is the custom, know ye, in this land of
ours, for the female seed of Bin-Nab to keep veiled
after they have reached the age of ten. I cast aside
my veil yester-eve, and immediately came to seek thee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?” asked Alan curtly.</p>

<p class='c012'>The woman was fair to look upon—her eyes were
deep and luminous, and her tear-stained cheeks filled
them with pity. Yet to be hampered with a woman
seemed to take from them every chance of their ultimate
escape.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah seemed to read their thoughts. “No,
harden not your hearts against me, for I can help you,”
said she earnestly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why have you sought us?” asked Alan, this time
less curtly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know a road in here—a secret road, said to be a
thousand and ten miles long; a stream of unknown
depths, races along by the side of it—a stream that is
swifter by far than the fastest of waters—there,” and
she pointed in the direction from which she had come.
“It leads to the tomb of Korah, so they say, but
torture was threatened to all who would have ventured
in search of it. O Ar-lane, you know not what our
tortures are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have seen some,” said Alan grimly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah laughed. “Nay, Ar-lane—you have never
seen what I have seen. You have never witnessed the
Curse of Fire.” As she spoke her eyes grew big and
her expression distorted as she lived again the scenes
she had so often witnessed. “I have seen men roasted
alive. I have seen acid juices poured on the sufferers’
wounds. I have seen—” but Alan stopped her.
“Enough!” he cried. “It’s horrible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She continued. “But tortures even worse were
threatened for those who would seek the tomb of
Korah. So none tried. I knew you would be safe for
a while in these caves—but I knew too, that with some
one to guide you, you might go farther even than you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>dared hope. I am weary of my life, I am an eighth
child of a priestess of the direct line of Bin-Nab; but I
have the blood of the living in my veins. I want to
live the life of the People of the Sun—your people.
That is the reason I cast my veil from me, O Men of
the Outer World, and sought you. Oh cast not Jez-Riah
from thee, but keep her as thy slave, for she will
by of much use to thee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah had cast herself at the boys’ feet, and her
tears and sobs were coming fast. Desmond and Alan
felt strangely moved at the sight of this woman, so
different from the women they were used to in the
world above.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think it’s trickery, Alan, do you?” said
Desmond. In his heart Alan believed in the truth of
the strange woman’s story, yet he knew from past
experience that it was impossible to believe the
inhabitants of the underworld.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked Jez-Riah up and down. “Any
weapons?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah held up her head proudly and her eyes
flashed fire and she stamped her foot. “I come
‘feula-ri!’ Is it likely I am traitor, O Men who
Doubt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now the boys knew enough of the customs of the
strange world in which they found themselves,
that if the sacred word “feula-ri—” was spoken, no
treachery was contemplated; for that word meant more
to them than does the white man’s flag of truce. For
in times of war, has not even the white flag been
violated?</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe you, Jez-Riah,” said Alan suddenly.
“Show us Korah’s tomb and perhaps we in turn may
find a way to show you the sun and moon and stars.
And green trees—and grass—and the sea—” He
drew his breath sharply. His imagination had run
away with him, and for the moment he could almost
believe he heard the thunder of the waves as they came
dashing in on some rocky shore; he saw the foam and
the sun-decked beach. The birds seemed to be singing—and
above it all came the unmusical cry of the gulls.
He sighed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Don’t Lannie,” said Desmond affectionately. “I
feel it too; shall we ever see those things again—shall
we ever feel the breeze on our faces and the burning
sun—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah stood looking at them hungrily. “You
speak your own tongue,” said she, “not mine. What
say you each to the other that makes the lines of sadness
on your faces grow so deep?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s nothing, Jez-Riah,” answered Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are sorry I am here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, we are glad—and you must help us with your
knowledge of the secret ways.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“See, I will show you at once,” and she rose and
crossed the cavern. She pressed a stone in the wall in
front of them, and a boulder revolved on a hidden
spring and showed a yawning cavity beyond. The
noise of troubled waters came upon their ears—loud
and thunderous.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is true,” she cried in triumph, “behold all I have
said is true. The waters are calling—come,” and she
went through into the blackness without a tremor of
fear. And Alan and Desmond followed their strange
companion without any misgivings for the future.</p>

<p class='c012'>Providence had sent them an unlooked for guide.
Hope, the star they had almost lost in the clouds of
darkness that had overshadowed them, came back,
shining in all the glory and radiance of renewed
fervour. With a muttered “Thank God” the two
boys stepped forward, lighter of step and gladder at
heart than they had been for some time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ar-lane—Jez-mun,” came a voice from the darkness.
“I am Jez-Riah—Child of the future—Gate of
Hope—Guide of Strangers. Fear nothing—the blackness
will pass and we shall find the way easy to tread.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And it was even as she had spoken. In a very little
time they found themselves in a maze of natural lighted
pathways similar to the ones from which they had come.
The sound of the water grew louder. It thundered in
their ears; it shrieked and roared as if some evil spirit
was shaking the very earth itself. Jez-Riah was
radiant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The stream of Korah is not far. I have heard it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>told that whoever braves that stream and finds the
tomb of Korah, will live to see the sun. The sun that
our prophet Zurishadeel sings of, the sun that the God
of our forefathers created. The thought puts new life
into me—Come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On, on they went, the noise getting louder and louder
every moment, until, upon turning a corner, a
wondrous sight met their eyes. Belching forth from
the rocks themselves, forcing itself out from regions
unseen, falling like a waterfall from some high
precipice, the torrent rushed, making a lake of considerable
dimensions, which was overflowing its banks—a
wild, mad, boiling liquid. The spray rose a hundred
feet in height, and splashed all round and the whole
place was fearsome and ghostly.</p>

<p class='c012'>At one end of the turbulent lake was a tiny outlet,
perhaps two feet wide, through which the waters ran at
breakneck speed. The fearsome noise, the sight of the
rushing waters, the intense weirdness of the scene,
kept both boys speechless with awe at their surroundings,
but Jez-Riah was on her knees, bathing her face
in the water, letting it trickle over her hair, drinking it
from cups made of her two hands. And above the din
and clamour they heard her singing a weird hymn of
praise to the accompaniment of the music of the waters.
The boys listened eagerly, and again and again they
heard the refrain—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Korah—Korah—father of our people—the waters will lead us to where thy bones lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Korah—Korah—thou hast not forsaken us—I am bathing in the waters of faith and purity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then Jez-Riah flung off her draperies and plunged
into the boiling waters. The boys watched in breathless
amazement as she battled with the whirlpools, but
she proved stronger than they, and swam on until she
reached the mighty waterfall. Round and round she
was carried and whirled but she reached her goal at
last—a tiny slab of rock protruding out of the waters
and under the shadow of the mighty cascade itself.
Standing upon it she began a weird dance—a fanatical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>dance of joy. The foaming waters almost hid her from
their gaze, the spray rose in front of her like a filmy
gauze. At moments, however, her lithe body was
exposed to view, and the boys marvelled at her agility.
She did not seem to tire, but danced on, her voice
raised in a strange hymn of praise. Praise of the
waters, praise of the light, praise to the God of the
Sun. Then came a mighty prayer that the secret ways
might be opened to her—and that she might lead the
strangers to safety. And even as she sang and prayed,
her limbs were moving fast in dance and the waters
were dashing over her and chilling her.</p>

<p class='c012'>When she had finished her prayer she sank to her
knees in an abandonment of grief and asked pardon for
her one great sin—the sin she committed in leaving the
temple, where she was Watcher to the Fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a long silence—only broken by the voices
of the torrent raised in its ceaseless dirge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan moved. “Is she safe?” he asked “What
will happen to her?”—but even as he spoke the lithe
body had dived once more into the waters and was
swimming almost with ease to the shore. Jez-Riah
stood proudly before them, her dripping hair a mantle
that covered her. “Go—rest,” she commanded. “I
commune with Korah,” and fleet of foot, strong in
purpose, she darted down one of the passages near by,
and was soon lost to sight.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE LAIR OF THE SERPENT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Korah! Korah!” the words grew fainter and fainter,
until at length, worn out with religious fervour, Jez-Riah
flung herself on the ground and fell asleep. Alan
and Desmond gazed after her for some time and then
Alan said “Let’s lie down, Dez. We are both worn
out, and it is useless to follow her. She will return to
us only when the spirit moves her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then for Heaven’s sake let us get away from this
infernal din.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They walked down one of the widest passages until
they came to a place where the moss was thick and
soft and the noise of the water rose faint upon their
ears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ar-lane—Jez-mun.” The cry came low and clear
and Alan rose quickly to his feet. He had been asleep
and his limbs felt rested and his head was clearer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is I, Jez-Riah,” came the soft tones again, and
silhouetted against the wall he saw the shadowy figure
of the strange woman.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must go on,” she urged “We have far to
go and much to do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where have you been?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have been in communication with the Spirit of
the Waters, O Ar-lane; soon the mysteries of Korah
will be unfolded before thine eyes. Come! Come!
Tarry not too long.” In a second Desmond was
awake, and Jez-Riah showed all impatience to start.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you been here before?” asked Desmond
curiously of Jez-Riah.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, O Jez-mun, but the water of Korah has given
me the gift of sight. Before I was blind—now I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>see. Come bind up my eyes, O Ar-lane, that clearness
of vision may be mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bind up my eyes,” she commanded again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan tore a strip from his purple mantle, and tied it
across her eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>She gave an exclamation of joy. “O Ar-lane,” she
cried. “Before I trod in darkness; now my path is
lighted brightly, and I can lead you to many strange
sights, and strange things.” As she spoke, she
stretched out her hands before her and started off at a
quick pace. In silence the cousins followed her. In
their position as prisoners in the earth, buried so far
down that they had little hope of ever seeing the sun
again, they had no choice but to follow the strange,
half mad creature who had constituted herself their
leader.</p>

<p class='c012'>The aspect of the road they were now traversing
changed. The sides of the passage were no longer
smooth and earthy, but consisted of a hard, rocky substance—the
floor, too, was jagged and rough. The
passage narrowed until it left only room for them to
walk in single file, and the air was musty and stifling;
indeed there was a pressure in the atmosphere that
made the boys from the upper, world stumble as they
felt the noxious gases going to their heads.</p>

<p class='c012'>They made brave efforts, however, and staggered
blindly on, one after the other, following Jez-Riah who
never hesitated a moment in the course she was taking.
For perhaps five miles they walked until they entered a
large cavern, the replica of the many others they had
been through. They noticed the change in the air
immediately. It was purer, fresher, even cooler and
the boys revived under its effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah tore the bandage from her eyes. “The
place of my dreams,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I feel faint,” said Desmond in a low tone, but not
so low that Jez-Riah could not hear. “He needs
food?” she questioned “Here is plenty,” and going
to the furthermost corner of the cave she pulled up roots
by the handful—roots like the ones they had had in the
lower world itself.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>All the time they had been walking they had been
continually ascending—at times the passages were
almost like mountain passes, they rose at such a
gradient—at other times the ascent was not so noticeable,
but all the same they realized that they were
mounting upward, and the thought cheered the two
white men.</p>

<p class='c012'>They sat and ate the roots and felt refreshed, when
suddenly Desmond rose with a cry. “My God—what’s
that?” There on the opposite wall, high above their
heads, a light shone down upon them, a light that
gleamed baleful in the semi-darkness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the sacred serpent of the Tomb,” cried Jez-Riah.
“I have heard of it often when I was a child.
It has existed throughout the ages—it will always
exist.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nonsense,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You cannot kill it,” she wailed “It is the
Guardian of the Tomb.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, are we there, at the Tomb of Korah,
already?” asked Alan in amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! No! But we must cross its path if we would
reach the Tomb. In my conceit I thought I was all
powerful. I was over-confident, O Ar-lane! I heeded
not the snake that is large enough to slay an enormous
army and yet retain its power.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The gleaming eyes grew nearer, and already they
could see the writhing body as it moved along a rocky
ledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How big is it?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot see its length,” whispered Alan “but it
seems as thick round as a man’s body. Let us get out
of this cursed place. Which is the way, Jez-Riah?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Through that narrow opening yonder,” said she.</p>

<p class='c012'>Flattening themselves against the wall they crept the
way she directed, and were but a few steps from it when
there came the sound of a terrible hissing, and a long
evil-looking shape dropped in front of them, and hung
pendulum-wise blocking up the opening.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We can’t go that way now,” said Alan “I am
afraid it’s too large to tackle. Why it must be thirty
feet long at least. We shall have to go back.” Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>came the most horrible experience the cousins had ever
had. The most awful. The most terrifying.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Run,” cried Alan. “If we can get into the passage
beyond we may be able to block up the way and prevent
it coming through after us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They reached the narrow opening, and all around
were huge blocks of rock and stone which they piled
up one on top of the other.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only one more is needed,” cried Alan triumphantly.
But he spoke too soon—a large, flat head, perhaps a
foot and a half in length, with ugly eyes glowing like
live fire, shot through the opening, and watched them.
The mouth was open wide and the forked tongue shot
rapidly in and out in venomous fury. The smell was
terrible, whether from its breath or permeating through
its skin from its body, they could not tell, but it made
them feel giddy, sick and ill. For perhaps ten minutes
(if time could be measured in that awful place) it
remained there motionless, and then gradually the
stones came tumbling down as it forced its way through
the barricade.</p>

<p class='c012'>The boys watched their horrible foe. They were
powerless. Escape was impossible, for behind them
was a narrow passage, perhaps a mile in length, that
offered no shelter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Would it never attack them? Why keep them in
this awful suspense?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Knife,” came suddenly from between Alan’s
tightly compressed lips. Then after a moment, during
which time he opened the well worn blade—“There
are plenty of stones behind?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Plenty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Swiftly followed the instructions. “Pick up the
largest you can handle—both of you—when I give the
word dash them at the brute’s head. It is our only
chance—then rush past the head.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But—” commenced Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t argue—it’s our only hope. The thing
is too big to turn round in this small space. It
<i>must</i> go on. Once we get past it we may stand a
chance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan never relaxed his watchful gaze. Suddenly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>reptile lowered its head and an ugly hiss came from its
mouth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” cried Alan, and as he hurled the knife,
harpoon-like into the open mouth two heavy stones
came crashing down on its skull.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sudden onslaught dazed the creature, and its
head dropped to the ground. Quickly they rushed past
it, but they all realized that they were not yet out of
danger. The passage they were in was very narrow
and the serpent was so immense that it was impossible
for them to stand without feeling the clammy skin next
to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah shuddered. “What will become of us?”
she moaned “It is too big to kill.” And indeed, it
seemed to be, for Alan had not exaggerated. The
length was quite thirty feet, and the girth of its middle
was perhaps ten feet, narrowing to two at the tail.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can’t kill it,” cried Desmond. “Why we
haven’t even the old clasp knife now.” A sudden convulsive
movement passed along the serpent’s body, and
it made them retch to see the tremor coming from its
head in undulating movements to its tail. Then it
raised itself up, and Alan was right—it was impossible
for it to turn—it was far too big and cumbersome. For
some time, with its head raised perhaps six feet from
the ground, it writhed to and fro in growing anger that
its prey should so elude it. As its anger grew greater,
its body rolled and moved in convulsive heaps, and the
trio sickened as the malodorous mass pressed itself
against them and pinioned them to the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lannie, what can we do?” asked Desmond.
Jez-Riah was almost unconscious with the awful
pressure, and the strain was telling on the two boys.
The strength of the beast was enormous, and they
realized that it had the power, even when at a disadvantage
itself, to press the very life out of them
against the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came a sudden sense of relief, as the serpent
contracted itself, but gave way to horror as they
realized that it was backing through the opening,
and its filthy head would soon be on a line with
them.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Stones,” urged Alan hoarsely. “Hurl them at the
head. Jez-Riah, you must help too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Feverishly they worked throwing rocks and stones
with force at the monster’s head. It withstood the
onslaught valiantly for a time—its strength was
enormous—but at last a well directed shot of
Desmond’s caught it full between the eyes, and the
head dropped like a stone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The serpent—it is dead?” asked Jez-Riah. “But
alas, no. The body is twitching all over—it has life
still.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A sharp piece of stone jutted out above Alan’s head.
“Help me,” he said feverishly to his cousin. “This
is our last hope—this is as sharp as a knife. If we can
but loosen it you must help me to imbed it in the
brute’s head. It is stunned now—we must try and
overpower it while it is in that condition.” All the
time they were talking they were working hard to
loosen the stone and at last it fell into Alan’s hands.
It was not very large, but it had an edge like a
bayonet, and was of intense hardness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cautiously they forced their way on either side of
the twisting mass, until they were on a level with its
head. “There,” whispered Desmond. “Just between
the eyes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The stone was raised; the huge beast was motionless—then,
with almost superhuman power, Alan brought
the stone down and embedded it deeply in the flesh,
while as Alan let go, Desmond hurled a heavy piece of
stone hammer-wise on the top of the stone, and buried
the sharp edge still deeper in the gaping wound. The
great snake woke to consciousness, and the boys had
only just time to get out of the way of its gaping
jaws. “Press yourself close to the wall, Dez,” commanded
Alan, and they reached Jez-Riah’s side in
safety. Their eyes dilated with horror as they watched
the great reptile die, for the boys between them had
given it its death blow.</p>

<p class='c012'>How long the death struggle lasted they never
knew. Alan thought an hour, Desmond said two.
Blood poured from the wound in its head and a sickly
smell rose from the liquid. For some time the stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>remained fixed in the flesh of the serpent, but its
writhings at last loosened it, and it fell to the ground
with a horrible thud, while the blood rushed out of
the open wound like a miniature fountain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Fascinated the three watched its last movements.
The body rolled from side to side, dashing first against
one then against the other of the unlucky prisoners,
but by flattening themselves against the walls, they
escaped any big injury—only bruises left their mark
to show what they had been through.</p>

<p class='c012'>The movements became more irregular. For a long
time the mighty snake remained quite still, only to
wake up again after a rest with renewed energy. At
last its spasms became less frequent and less powerful.
It was dying. Its breath came like huge sobs that
travelled down its body. The stench was almost
unendurable. “I think it’s safe now,” said Alan at
last. Slowly they moved from their cramped positions.
Their hearts throbbed and their limbs ached.
Fearsomely they gave a last look at the head of the
dying, if not already dead, monster. A shudder ran
through them all. The strain through which they had
passed had been terrible, but for Alan, who had
engineered the defeat, it had been terrific. His limbs
ached, his head swam, and he reeled as he walked on
the free ground, unpolluted by the serpent. He
laughed a wild unnatural laugh; it sounded strange
even in his own ears, and he repeated it, as he
wondered whether he was indeed going mad. He felt
suddenly unaccountably frightened. Everything faded
from him but the memory of the serpent behind.
With another peal of almost senseless laughter, he
ran madly away into the distance, until the darkness
swallowed him up, and only the sound of his wild
laughter broke the stillness. Jez-Riah clutched at her
throat and spoke to Desmond. “Ar-lane—he is ill—come,”
said she, and the two followed Alan away
into the blackness as he sped on, laughing—laughing—laughing.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>ON THE WAY TO THE TOMB OF KORAH</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Time passed—time that had no measure—time that
seemed an eternity. They had all recovered from their
encounter with the Sacred Serpent, but the adventure
had left them nervous and irritable. There was food
in plenty, and the luscious roots gave them both meat
and drink. Always upward they mounted—and as
they saw the mountainous paths rise before them,
hope held out her encouraging hand, and whispered
that one day they might even see the stars. Jez-Riah
still led them on, through untold paths and a labyrinthine
maze. She always maintained that she knew the
right path to take.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes they had to crawl on their hands and
knees through narrow and low passages that seemed
to have no end. At other times they found themselves
in wide, airy byways with a height almost beyond
computation, for far above their heads they could just
catch the faintest glimmer of light on the purple
growth that covered the roof. Now and again springs
bubbled up from the earth and ran along beside them,
burying themselves as suddenly as they had appeared.
The atmosphere was very sultry and fetid—very
different from the air on the other side of the underground
river that separated the underworld people
from the desolate region they were now in. “How
long, Jez-Riah?” they asked her over and over again.
“How long before we reach the Tomb of Korah?”
And her answer was the same each time. “Oh Men
of the World Above, I do not tarry, I am leading you
to the Tomb as fast as I can. Be content with that.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>So the days passed—so the nights came round again.
Days which had no night, nights which had no day.
Time was measured by sleep. When they were all
weary they lay down to rest and sleep. This they
called night—when they awoke they called it day.
But they had lost count of the times they had slept
since Jez-Riah had come to them, they had lost count
of everything. They had only one object before them—to
reach the Tomb of Korah. Their plans ended
there; they had no idea what their next move would
be after they reached it. They had grown accustomed
to their strange, purple companion—in fact she had
become almost a necessity to them both. It was she
who passed many weary hours for them, by recounting
stories of the life of her people since they had
lived below. It was she who told them even more
fully than Har-Barim had done, how her people’s
forefathers had risen up against Musereah, and Har-Raeon,
and how they had consequently suffered
throughout the ages. And both the boys translated
Musereah as Moses, and Har-Raeon as Aaron, and
were more than ever convinced that strange as the
story was, this new race was indeed descended from
the Israelites of the Old Testament and could claim
Korah, Abiram and Dathan as its progenitors.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Jez-Riah who told them that behind a barred
gate was built a golden tomb wherein had been
deposited the remains of their first priests—“Har-Barim
and Kartharn.” It was at their shrine that the
ceremonies attached to the feast of Meherut were
performed. It was their Holy of Holies, and it was
over the bones of Har-Barim and Kartharn that the
priests made their vows.</p>

<p class='c012'>They asked Jez-Riah about the fire and she grew
solemn as she answered them—“Ah, Men from
Above, Our Fire is sacred—it is Holy. It is the
symbol of our Jovah.—It is almost our God. The
God of our forefathers took on one occasion the form
of fire, so fire is sacred to us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Burning Bush,” said Alan in an undertone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” she added sorrowfully, “the power of the
Fire is waning. According to one of our prophecies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>when the Fire shall die, then, also shall all the seed of
Korah die too. In all the ages that have passed since
the earth closed against us, no fuel was needed for
the Fire—it burnt of itself and never grew less. Then
one day noises were heard in the earth—our land shook
and trembled, and men fell on their faces in fear.
From that day we knew the Fire was growing less.
Our priests knew it—all our people knew it and terror
was in all our hearts. Then our high priest looked
up all the old laws and in the fourth book of Rabez-ka,
Queebenhah the Seer writes—</p>

<p class='c017'>‘When the Fire shall shrink, then is the time ripe for
the people of Kalvar to rise. Live sacrifices must be
offered to appease the God of Anger. Send forth a
Light to the world above, and let it bring back men and
animals and birds to feed the furnace of Light. Live
sacrifices alone will keep the fire quickened—live
sacrifices alone will prevent calamities falling on the
Children of Kalvar.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“So our wise men gathered together,” she continued,
“and by the wisdom of all, the Light was
made. The wise men of the temple and Kaweeka
alone could handle it—for they were possessed of
Holiness, and the Light was made from the Fire itself.
Chemicals were drawn from the recesses of the earth,
and in secret the Light was made.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did they use it, Jez-Riah?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When it was sent out into the earth above, it was
sensitive only to life. When any warm living thing of
the world was near, it swooped down, and coiled
round and carried its prey back to us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understand better,” said Alan to his cousin.
“The Light is some magnetic electrical current with
abnormal power. Ugh! It’s horrible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why did they stop sending out the Light for
fodder to feed the flames?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because we realized that our time is short.
Nothing will keep the Fire alive. The end is near.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So they travelled—and then depression overtook
them as their journey seemed endless and they got no
nearer to their goal. Even Jez-Riah herself seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>lose hope, and with tears in her eyes she would say
pathetically “O Ar-lane, my senses seem dimmed—the
way is dark. Surely we must come there soon!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The monotony of the way drove the white men
nearly mad. The monotony of the food sickened
them. They felt half dazed; they forgot the reason
of their march; they forgot, even, what the goal was
toward which they were going. They knew only that
some power within them urged them to go on and
on and always on.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last Jez-Riah’s eyes grew bright and her step
alert. “Don’t speak,” she urged, “don’t speak!”
So they went, until all the passages merged into one
long tunnel—darker than the others through which
they had come. The natural light shed from the earth
itself, grew still more feeble, and they found it difficult
to walk for fear of hidden pitfalls. Suddenly the
passage ended and Jez-Riah gave a glad cry.
“Behold, O Men of the Sun, this is the entrance to
the Tomb of Korah.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite, O Ar-lane. The paths we have been
traversing were made by our forefathers long æons
ago. After they had fastened Korah and all that
appertained to him fast within the bowels of the earth,
they had to fight their way through to make a place
of habitation. They cut paths as they marched along,
and when they found the Fire—there they made their
home. I knew that when all paths merged into one,
the way was near to Korah’s tomb.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The place in which they found themselves was very
disappointing. Their way just ended—it did not widen
out at all, and the end was piled with stones and earth
that had fallen through the ages. Their quest was
over at last, and they took their first untroubled rest.
They slept long and quietly, and it was Jez-Riah who
awakened them and placed before them the food they
were so heartily sick of. “Nay, eat,” she commanded,
“your strength is needed more than before,” and
feeling the truth of her words, they ate until they were
satisfied and felt all the better for the food.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The earth has fallen,” said Jez-Riah. “If we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to find the entrance to the tomb we must clear away
all that rubble.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Feverishly they set to work tearing their hands to
pieces on the jagged stones until the passage behind
them was nearly closed with the mass of rock and earth
that they had displaced. Twice they slept, and then
success came to them, for a solid slab of rock appeared
in the wall—a rock that had been made smooth and
upon which were carven hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot read it,” said Jez-Riah, but Alan was
already translating, for it was the Hebrew he knew,
and not the corruption that had come down through
the ages to the purple people.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Read it aloud,” said Desmond, and Alan spoke
the words of the inscription reverently.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c018'>
    <div>“BY THE WILL OF THE EXILED CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Korah, son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
Levi, and his wives and his children and all that appertains
unto him and to them, lie buried in this cave. For
the wrath of Jehovah fell on his people who sinned against
the Lord, tempted by the Evil one—Korah. This is his
Tomb—cursed be the ones who open it before the day
appointed is at hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, the son of Peleth,
son of Reuben; Shedur, son of Helon, son of Abira, the son
of Simeon. Priests, chosen by the banished Children of
Israel in their new land of Kalvar—in the bowels of the
earth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cousins did little else but talk about the
discovery until the time came for them to rest. Their
labours had been rewarded; the Tomb of Korah had
been revealed to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>They worked hard when they awoke to move the
massive block of stone. There was no secret spring
to assist them—the stone had been placed in position
some three thousand years before, and now seemed to
defy all the efforts they made to move it. With rocks
and stones used lever-wise they worked until after many
“days” they succeeded in forcing the solid block of
stone to the ground, but behind it was a wall closely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>built of stones and earth bound together with a rude
cement. Their fingers were torn and bleeding in their
attempt to pull the stones apart. “At last,” cried
Alan in delight. For as he worked his hand had gone
into space—the tomb was laid open before him.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE TOMB OF KORAH</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Tomb of Korah! They had reached their goal
at last! The boys stood back awed at the thought of
what might have passed in that selfsame cavern
thousands of years before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You go first, Jez-Riah,” said Alan at last, and
slowly, reverently the two boys followed her in. The
natural light had grown stronger and allowed them to
see quite plainly the mysteries the cave was to unfold.
They discovered it to be a cavern perhaps forty yards
square. The roof rose above them perhaps a hundred
feet, and was marked by a deep, zigzagged line
running across it from one side to the other. It was
like a scar!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dez,” said Alan suddenly, “is that where the
earth originally opened, when it deposited Korah and
the other Israelites within its bowels?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If so we ought to be somewhere in the neighbourhood
of Palestine,” replied Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>The cave had no outlet, and on the floor lay precious
stones of every kind and colour;—diamonds, rubies,
pearls, emeralds, sapphires—as large as Barcelona
nuts—lay strewn about in fabulous quantities. In one
corner of the cave were the remains of furniture and
household goods, mostly rotted away and eaten by
worms; and mingled with the precious stones were
human bones—human bones in such quantities that it
was impossible to avoid treading on them. Here was
a thigh bone, there a skeleton hand or a skull. Everywhere
the bones of men and beasts mingled together
in a heterogeneous mass.</p>

<p class='c012'>Quietly, slowly they made a round of the place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>There were skeletons of horses, asses and camels lying
together in a corner, and piled on top of each other
in such a way as proved it had been done by the human
agency, were the remains of little children.</p>

<p class='c012'>Skeletons of females with the remnants of clothing
on their whitened bones, adorned with anklets of gold
and bracelets set with gems, were everywhere, and
the whole scene was like a ghastly wonder story of
the East. They picked their way through a bed of
grinning skulls to where they saw something shining.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan picked it up. “A censer,” said he, “one of
the most beautiful I have ever seen,” And indeed it
was of wonderful workmanship. Even their little
knowledge told them it was of pure gold; it was most
wonderfully fashioned to represent on the one side a
cherub—a cherub so perfect that even the finger nails
were represented, and on the other, bunches of grapes
and vine leaves—symbols of the promised land.</p>

<p class='c012'>Precious stones gleamed cunningly everywhere, and
the chains from which the censer swung were studded
with diamonds. They could scarcely bear to put it
down, but gazed at it entranced with its beauty.
Every moment they found in it some greater glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have seen nothing modern even resembling
this,” said Alan at last. “Why, it is exquisite—think
of its value!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Its history alone would render it priceless,” said
Desmond, “apart from its precious metal and workmanship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but of what use is it to us down here?”
questioned Alan. “And even if we ever do get out,
who will believe our story?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder where we shall find ourselves if we do
discover a way out,” said Desmond. “We have lost
all sense of direction down here—of distance and of
time. Why, we haven’t even any idea of how far we
have walked since we left the purple people—how far
do you think, Alan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan shook his head. “It’s impossible to say, Dez.
How many times have we slept? We counted three
hundred times and then forgot—three hundred times
is a long while, old boy. We must have walked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>least fifteen miles each ‘day’ we have been on the
march—perhaps even more—so we have done a
considerable distance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then where shall we find ourselves? Africa?
America? Asia?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we shall not be penniless when we do get
to the world again,” and Alan pointed at the wealth
of jewels at their feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is those that make me feel we shall never get
out,” said Desmond despondently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because it is only in books of romance that such
an adventure as ours would culminate successfully,
and it would only be in a Romance of Romances that
adventurers would come back from the very centre
of the earth, laden with such untold wealth!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be so depressing, Dez,” laughed Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it’s true, Lanny. With wealth like this in
our hands we could command the trades of the entire
world. Why, with this we could corner wheat—corner
cotton—corner millionaires themselves—if we were
permitted to use it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why permitted?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it depends on the government of the country
we eventually land in; they will want their share. If
it’s France we may get one half—if it’s Spain perhaps
an eighth—Russia?—well, nothing at all and the salt
mines into the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very cheerful,” laughed Alan, “but as a
matter of fact, I’ve been planning what I mean to do
with my share if we do get out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah had been listening to the two boys speaking
and sighed deeply. They were talking in their own
language and had forgotten all about their strange
companion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will happen to her if we ever do reach the
upper world?” said Desmond suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked soberly at the quaint little purple
creature who had so grown into their lives, who had
been so useful to them, who had become almost a
friend. They treated her as they would some great,
faithful hound who was devoted to them alone. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>was like a dumb animal in her unwavering loyalty to
them, and indeed would have laid down her very life
for her friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She’ll have no easy time, poor thing,” said Alan,
“but I’ll use every scrap of my energy to prevent an
Earl’s Court Exhibition for her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again Jez-Riah sighed and a tear rolled down her
cheek.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What ails thee?” asked Alan in her own language.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sad and sorrowful, O Ar-lane,” she replied.
“The memory of a prophecy has come to me. I shall
see the stars of Heaven—the Sun in the Sky—but with
pain alone will such sights come to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll keep pain from you,” said Alan kindly. “If
you are to see the stars, then that means we shall all
find a way out from here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The boys set to work to try and find Korah’s
remains and an outlet to the world above. Many times
they slept, and their last waking thought was—“Shall
we find a way out to-morrow?” They counted the
skeletons and piled them reverently in one corner.
They counted the remains of twenty-two women,
forty-nine men and about thirty children, some of
whom appeared to be but newly born.</p>

<p class='c012'>They gathered the precious stones, and placed
perhaps a gallon measureful in a basket Jez-Riah had
plaited out of the roots of the mautzer—her fingers
were busy the whole time they were exploring the
cavern and its contents.</p>

<p class='c012'>She had made a covering for the censer, and that
had been put carefully aside. The furniture and tenting
was all valueless. It fell to pieces at a touch and
only small scraps of tinder-like material remained to
prove the glories of the silken coverings that had
been buried with the Israelites of old. Harness made
of leather, and trappings bound with gold lay on the
ground mixed up with the bones of the animals they
had adorned; chariot wheels lay among the wreckage,
and the whole scene was one of utter desolation and
carnage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know of a way out?” asked Alan of
Jez-Riah over and over again, and always she answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“I have brought you in safety to the tomb of Korah,
O my friends. Further the way is hidden from me.
Now I trust to you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no apparent outlet from the cavern, and
the boys hunted for any written record that might have
been left behind by Korah or his company. “I want
a proof of our statements,” said Alan. “When we
get to the upper world we shall be looked upon as
madmen if we are unable to substantiate our story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Jez-Riah would say, “Give up hunting for
records of my forefathers, I beg you, and turn your
energies to find a way to the sun—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was thinking deeply on the situation they were
in, when his eyes were caught by the scar on the roof.
“I wonder,” said he suddenly, “I wonder if there
is a way out—there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan jerked his head in the direction of the scar.
“It would be madness to try and find out,” said he.
“The ledges of rock are not strong enough to bear
one—don’t think of risking your life in such a foolish
adventure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And indeed it seemed almost impossible. The walls
of the cavern were jagged and rough, and in many
places overhung in a dangerous manner. To climb
to the roof would have made even an experienced
Alpine climber think twice before he attempted it, and
to one inexperienced in such feats it seemed like
courting death.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You wouldn’t try,” Desmond urged. He knew
Alan of old, and feared for him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan laughed. “Is it likely?” was all he said.
But all the same the thought remained in his mind,
and his brain was working.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was time to go to sleep. They had supped off
the roots of mautzer, and had drunk the liquid from
the stems of the elers, and felt refreshed. Jez-Riah
was already breathing softly, and Desmond was talking
in fitful gusts with drowsy interludes between. Of
the three, Alan alone was wide awake. He answered
Desmond quietly, and he at last dropped off to sleep too.
For some time Alan remained quite quiet, afraid lest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>a tiny movement of his might awaken either of his
companions. Then Jez-Riah’s breath came in deep,
indrawn sighs, and Desmond lay with one hand over
his head and his lips slightly apart. Alan looked at
them both closely—they were fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>Stealthily he rose and stepped past the sleepers
through the low way into the Tomb of Korah. He
moved with purpose, for his plans were all carefully
thought out. High up in the roof, at the farthest
right hand corner, the scar seemed its widest. Quickly
he walked toward it, and without a backward glance
began a long, dangerous and arduous climb. The
rocks were slippery, and the foothold almost nothing,
yet with tenacious pluck he kept on until his fingers
were lacerated and his limbs ached. Pulling himself
up by the jagged pieces of rock, he came closer to the
roof. Once only he looked below, and his heart
pumped and his head swam as he saw the depths
beneath. After that he kept his eyes bent upward,
and he did not stop until he could touch the roof itself.
There was a little ledge, three feet from the top, which
was big enough for him to sit on fairly comfortably,
and his breath came in hard gasps as he rested.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, as his strength came back to him, he carefully
put his hand inside the fissure. A stone moved, and
as he withdrew his hand, it dropped into the cave
beneath, and the sickening thud made him tremble.
He heard the sound of rushing waters. Gradually he
wormed his way until he was seated in the fissure
itself, and looked down on a swiftly flowing river
twenty feet below him. It was very swift—he could
not tell its depth, neither could he get down to it—for
the water had neither bank nor ledge to stand
upon. High walls reared on either side of the water
as it raced on its mad journey. He watched the swirling
depths. The spray at times reached his face, and
cooled him. The water was of a different colour from
the rivers in Kalvar—it looked cleaner, fresher. “I
wonder whither it leads,” he muttered, and then he
examined his position.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was inside the fissure on a ledge perhaps three
feet wide. There was a sheer drop into the waters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>below of twenty feet. There was no other outlet at
all. If they were to escape it would have to be by the
water. It was impossible to go back. Then a daring
plan came to him. “If we had the pluck,” said he
to himself, “Well, it will be do or die.” and slowly
he turned his attention to the descent.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE PAPYRUS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Desmond had slept well; he woke lazily and looked
round him. Alan had already gone. He turned
sleepily over, but raised himself quickly as Alan hailed
him from Korah’s tomb with an exultant shout. Even
Jez-Riah realized that something of import had
happened as she watched Alan enter, bubbling over
with excitement, and his eyes bright and shining.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” asked Desmond eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve found the remains of Korah.” Alan made
the announcement quietly, but his cousin saw the
undercurrent of excitement that lay beneath his
words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve found Korah?” he repeated stupidly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen,” went on Alan eagerly, and speaking in
the quaint Hebraic dialect, so that Jez-Riah might
share his news, he told them of his adventure to the
roof of the cave, and of the river beyond. “Well,”
he concluded, “as I neared the bottom my foot slipped
and I clutched at a piece of jutting rock to save me,
and I had to use all my strength to keep from falling.
My foothold gone, I had to worm my way round the
rock to find another place easy of descent. You know
the wall is full of cracks and crevices. I came upon
a crevice larger than the others. It was big enough
to get through, and I wondered why we hadn’t noticed
it before. I realized, however, the tricks the lighting
of this place plays upon us, and I could see that the
hole simply looked like a shadow on the wall, so
cunningly is it hidden. I scrambled easily through,
and found it to be a cave, quite small, in the middle of
which is a deep pond of water, and fastened on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>wall by the aid of rude nails was this—” and he held
out a roll of parchment that crackled at his touch.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond examined it curiously. “Why it’s a
papyrus,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes! and written by Korah himself, and placed
there just before he died.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you read it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, it’s quite easy in parts. Listen,” and Alan
translated from the old and faded Hebraic characters
the following,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c018'>
    <div>“WRITING by KORAH, known henceforth to all generations as KORAH THE ACCURSED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Know, then, these four months, as far as it is possible
to judge time in this accursed spot, I and all my belongings
have remained in this cavern. Abiram and Dathan
have sealed the doors of stone against us. Escape is
impossible. There is naught for us to do but die. Be
it known—I—Korah the Accursed—am sore at heart for
my sins of rebellion against Moses and Aaron. Jehovah
has inflicted upon us all a grievous punishment. His
name be praised. Food there is none except that which
came down with us into this pit of terror. Lord of
Hosts, I tremble at what I see. Mothers tearing their
little ones, women in childbirth crying to the God in
Heaven that they may die before they are delivered. I—Korah—alone
have remained fasting. It is the only
reparation I can make for my sins, and for the unworthiness
I have shown as one of Jehovah’s chosen
ones. I Korah—”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came a space that was unintelligible. Time
had worked its will and the writing was indistinct,
and in parts entirely erased. “How awful,” said
Desmond, shuddering. “Think—half these skeletons
here were perhaps murdered by their brothers for food.
What agonies, what pangs they must have suffered!”
“Wait—there is more,” said Alan, and he went on
translating,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Forty days and forty nights fasting is as nothing to
the fasting here. It seems forty times forty since food
passed my parched and cracked lips. My people turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>not upon me and slay me. Oh that they would! Dead
flesh is rotting all around me—the air is heavy with
the stench. There are none now left alive but myself.
I will fasten this to the wall of the inner cave, and then
lay me down to die. Of what use are gold and riches
to us here? Poorer am I than the most disease-laden
beggar of the world above. O God of Hosts forgive
Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
Levi.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For some time after Alan had finished reading the
boys remained in silence. The whole scene rose up
in their minds like a picture, and the horror of
it nauseated them. The terrible hunger and thirst of
the captives-the scenes of cannibalism afterwards—the
child murder—it was revolting. “Now,” said
Alan. “Come to the real tomb of Korah. This is
the tomb of his people—but he lies yonder.” So the
three of them mounted the rough steps in the rock,
and ten feet above their heads was the little opening.
Just a little cleft through which they passed, and down
a short but steep path into the cave below.</p>

<p class='c012'>The centre of the cave was taken up by a deep pool
of water, but a narrow path ran all round. A huge
block of stone lay immersed in the water and round it
the water bubbled and sang showing the place where
the pond had its birth.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Desmond saw no sign of the bones of Korah.
He looked puzzled. “There is no skeleton here,”
said he. “Where is Korah?” Silently Alan pointed
to the grey rock over which the water was lapping.
Desmond looked at it intently-and then understood.
In the course of time a spring had bubbled up and the
waters had covered the body of Korah. Some
chemical property in the water had preserved the dead
body and turned it to stone, and in the ages that had
passed deposits of lime and other minerals had been
secreted on the body, until it was now of gargantuan
size. Still plain, however, were the features. A
rather long nose, Semitic in shape, protruded from
a face that had possessed prominent cheek-bones and
deep, sunken eyes. The hair which had been long
was now a mass of stone that mingled with the shapeless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>body. They could just trace the semblance of
arms that were folded across the stone chest, and there
was the suspicion of feet protruding from a kilted
tunic of cold grey stone.</p>

<p class='c012'>In all, just a shapeless boulder in which could be
traced the likeness of what had once been a living man.
The waters of the centuries had preserved Korah
alone of the Israelites of old who had been imprisoned
in the pit.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah had listened in silence. With one finger she
had traced the outlines of the once handsome face—now
she spoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He killed himself—in the water?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Alan, “I think the cave was dry in those
days. He just came here to die; and in the place where
his dead body lay, before time could rot the flesh, a
spring broke through the floor of the cave and preserved
him—a memorial to all time of his sin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Praise be to Jovah,” said Jez-Riah in a hushed
tone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Requiescat in pace</span></i>,” said Alan as they turned to
leave the place. “Amen,” whispered his cousin—and
Korah was once more left alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said Alan some time later while they were
having their meal, “now we must make some arrangements
about leaving this place. The only way is by
the river, yonder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can we make a raft strong enough to bear us?”
asked Desmond. Alan shook his head. “I’ve already
investigated,” he said. “There is absolutely nothing.
The wood in there is rotten with age. I doubt whether
it would even float. There is only one possible way,”
and he looked at them intently. “We can all swim
pretty well. Our only hope is to throw ourselves on
the mercy of the waters. The knowledge we have of
swimming will enable us to keep our heads out of the
water—we must trust the current to do the rest. It
may mean death—but are we not in a living death
already? At any rate are you willing to try?” They
walked into the big cave and Desmond looked fearfully
at the terrible ascent which they would have to
make in order to reach the river, for it flowed on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>much higher level than that on which they were
themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, it’s pretty stiff,” said Alan grimly. “But it’s
that or nothing. Are you ready to risk it?” For a
moment only, Desmond hesitated, then his mind was
made up and his hand gripped that of his cousin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said he. “What about you, Jez-Riah?”
And they were both surprised at the calm way in which
she took the suggestion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is very high,” said she. “How easy it would be
to fall!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They rested and slept and ate before they attempted
the ascent. Also they had many preparations to make.
There was certain of the jewels to be taken with them—the
papyrus and the censer. Jez-Riah plaited a waterproof
case for the parchment, and with a plaited rope
fastened it to Alan’s shoulders. The jewels were
divided out between them and placed in little bags that
Jez-Riah wove from the root tendrils that grew outside
the large cave. The censer proved the greatest
difficulty. It was not only heavy, but exceedingly bulky
and cumbersome. It was Alan again who decided to
carry it. “But it will drag you down,” objected his
cousin. “I’ll manage it,” he replied, and he had it
fastened securely to his back with the strong rope that
Jez-Riah could make so quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>So they began their arduous climb. Alan went
first, followed by Jez-Riah, and Desmond brought up
the rear. “On no account look down,” Alan kept
urging. “It will be fatal if you do.” At last they
reached the tiny platform. Alan looked at it doubtfully.
Would it hold three grown persons? He
shivered—it would be a tight squeeze. His hand went
down and met Jez-Riah’s. He pulled her on to their
resting place in safety, and then Desmond reached it,
and for a while they sat in silence. The rushing of the
waters could be plainly heard. Time was passing—Alan
dared not move, for Jez-Riah, worn out with the
climb, was leaning heavily against him, and he knew
that the slightest movement from one or the other of
them might send them to their death, for the seat was
none too safe. “I think the time has come for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>action,” said he quietly at last. “It is useless to wait
here any longer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah moved restlessly. “What your will is, O
Ar-lane, that will I do,” said she.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am going to plunge in the water,” announced
Alan. “If you see my body rise—follow me quickly.
Do not struggle, let the current do its will with you.
Safety lies in submission.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why wait to see if you rise?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because I do not know what whirlpools may be
hidden there. If you do not see me after I have
plunged in, then you must do as you think best. But
surely death is preferable to a lifetime here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I shan’t—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t argue, old man. Do as I bid you. God
bless you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cousins solemnly shook hands, lingering
pathetically. It was like a good-bye to the dying.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ar-lane, O Ar-lane,” came from Jez-Riah.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have courage, little sister, be brave and follow
me.” And before they could say another word, he had
swung himself over the edge and had dropped into the
foaming water.</p>

<p class='c012'>The water hissed and roared with fury as it felt the
presence of the foreign body—then it quieted a little.
Alan’s head appeared, his face deathly pale, and before
they realized it, he was out of sight, borne on the swift
current.</p>

<p class='c012'>Jez-Riah was trembling. “Be brave, little sister.”
Almost unconsciously Desmond repeated his cousin’s
words. She clung to him for a second, and then with a
little frightened moan that went as soon as it was
uttered, she too dropped into the water below, and was
carried out of sight. Suddenly a great fear came over
Desmond. He was alone. The cavern seemed to ring
with laughter—the laughter of dead men. He hovered
at the edge of the little cleft and looked deep into the
boiling mass below, but he dared not drop in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t, I can’t,” he moaned, and the awful loneliness
came upon him and enveloped him in a cloak of
terror.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked behind him at the yawning chasm below.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>If he lost his foothold—he shuddered. And then with
a mighty spring and a muttered “God help me,” he
followed in the wake of his cousin. The water closed
over him—he held his breath until his lungs felt as if
they would burst with the strain. Relief came at last,
the waters had calmed a little, and he was floating
gently on the current. He was conscious of intense
inky blackness, of icy waters and a fetid air above; of
a swiftly moving stream, that, although not rough, was
running fast; of strange shapes that seemed to hover
about him, and long, clammy hands that tried to pull
him out of the water. He knew it was death himself
he was fighting, and he fought to evade the fingers that
were now so near, almost clasped round his throat.
Then his senses forsook him and he was only an atom,
tossed about on the bosom of the unknown river, a
nothingness in a world of mystery and wonder.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>THE ESCAPE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And the seventh day was the Sabbath! The Lord
rested on the Sabbath! Sabbath! Seventh!
Seventh! Sabbath! These words kept ringing in
Alan’s ears as he lay quiet and tranquil in the darkness.
He wondered where he was, but was too tired to make
much effort to find out. His senses were dulled and
his whole body ached; he could see nothing, for total
darkness surrounded him. Then unconsciousness again
overtook him, and he dreamed again of the Marshfielden
fields and the rippling brooks.</p>

<p class='c012'>When he awoke it was with a healthy feeling of
hunger, and gradually his senses returned and he
wondered where his cousin and Jez-Riah were. He
called them by name, but there was no reply. He
reached out on either side of him, but could feel
nothing—he seemed to be alone. The silence was
oppressive, the air heavy, and he found a great difficulty
in breathing. He tried to think of the mad plunge for
freedom into the swift underground river; he remembered
feeling the cold waters close over him, followed
by an interminable time under water when he could not
breathe, when his lungs were bursting, longing to disgorge
the used up air within him. Then he remembered
a feeling of relief as he drew in a long breath of
air, and afterwards—no more. He seemed to have
fallen into a never ending dream. Now at last he
realized he was safe again, and in his heart he thanked
God for having watched over him and brought him
once more to safety.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the past events became clearer, Alan rose up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>cautiously, but his head came in contact with the roof
of the place he was in. He went on all fours and
groped his way round the place. It was very small,
perhaps twenty yards in circumference, and perfectly
dark. Suddenly his hand touched something, something
warm. It was Jez-Riah, and, close beside her
lay Desmond. He spoke to them each in turn—shook
them, but they showed no sign of having heard him.
He listened for their heart beats, but neither showed
any sign of life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The water that had carried them all to this new
abode ran near, and Alan dragged the two bodies to
the water’s edge. He dipped his hand in the cool
liquid and found that it was only an inch or two deep
at the most. He made a cup with his hands and dashed
the water into his companions’ faces in turn, and at last
was rewarded by a heavy sob from Jez-Riah and a
groan from Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dez, old man, how are you feeling now? Jez-Riah,
are you better?”</p>

<p class='c012'>So from one to the other he turned, his only thought
to bring them back to life and hope.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly Desmond spoke. “That was a near shave,
Lanny.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How are you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I feel beastly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we?” suddenly asked Jez-Riah.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve no idea. The river has either disappeared
underground or we’ve been brought up a little side
creek and left the main channel itself. There is very
little water here—only a few inches at the most and it
is running very sluggishly. There is a tunnel to the
right up which we must have come, but it is very low;
I can hear the sound of swiftly running waters, but I
don’t feel strong enough to investigate in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course not, Alan,” answered Desmond, and
then Jez-Riah said pathetically, “I am hungry, O
Ar-lane.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan shook his head wearily. “There is no food
here. The purple light has gone. I am afraid we are
far from the vegetation of the underworld.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They talked in low tones for some time—they all felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>ill and weak. The papyrus and all their treasures were
so far safe, and the censer still remained fast on Alan’s
back. Their clothes were nearly dry, so they realized
they must have been thrown up by the water for some
considerable time. While they talked they suddenly
heard the sound of heavy blows from somewhere above
their heads. Then the sounds increased and they heard
that which it was impossible for them to mistake—they
knew it too well—the dull roar of blasting operations
in a mine!</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan’s eyes were shining. “Did you hear that?” he
asked excitedly. “You know that sound? Haven’t
you heard that dull roar in the pit at Grimland?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond spoke huskily. “You mean that we
are—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are immediately below a mine. White men are
not far away, I am sure. They may be Britishers like
ourselves—oh, how can we get to them?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Wildly they hacked at the roof above them, but the
sounds they made were puny and little and made no
impression in the distance. Tired and weary they all
fell asleep, and when they awoke there was silence
everywhere. They were suffering terribly from
hunger; could they have seen themselves they would
have been shocked at their appearance. Pale,
emaciated, with hollowed eyes and deep furrowed
cheeks, they looked almost like old men, instead of
youths still in the glory of their manhood.</p>

<p class='c012'>They fell into a stupor, and hardly roused themselves,
so weak and tired were they, when all at once there
came upon their ears a mighty explosion which shook
the place they were in and sent stones and rocks hurtling
all about them in the darkness. Then came a
rumbling deep and terrible.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all right,” whispered Alan. “They are only
blasting again.” But neither Desmond nor Jez-Riah
answered him. Weak and hungry they lay inert and
senseless upon the ground. The throbbing overhead
began again, and Alan alone in his agony beat at the
roof with his hands, but realizing his weakness fell on
the ground beside his cousin and gave vent to dry, hard
sobs.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>He listened to his cousin babbling meaninglessly in
the throes of fever, and he heard the pitiful cry of the
purple woman as she asked for water to moisten her
parched mouth. Then he too gave way. Strong and
brave he had been through all their privations, but he
cried and chattered insanely to the figures he conjured
up in the darkness. Death was hovering near them;
the Black Angel was standing by them, and the Reaper
had his scythe in his hand only waiting for the opportunity
that he hoped would come, and that would enable
him to cut down three more sheaves for his well stocked
granary.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c012'>“I can’t think where the water comes from, Mr.
Vermont. There must be a hidden spring somewhere.
Can I have the pumps going and make preparations
for an excavation?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly, Mennell, when you like,” and William
Mennell, foreman of the Westpoint Gold Mines in
Walla Balla, Australia, started his preparations.</p>

<p class='c012'>The part of the mine he was working on at the
moment was overrun with water, which made the working
very difficult, and was causing a great deal of
anxiety about the ultimate safety of the mine. The
pumps were made ready, a shaft was sunk, and they
began to work.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The trouble is there, sir,” said he, indicating the
ground under his foot. “I’ll have it all up to-morrow.”
By six the next morning the men were hard at work,
and merrily they shovelled the earth aside, cracking
jokes meanwhile. Suddenly one of the men lurched
forward and gave a cry as he threw himself backward
on the ground behind him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s up, Bill? Tea too strong this morning?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take care,” he shouted. “There’s a landslip or
something. My spade went right through. There’s a
hole there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Carefully they examined the place, and found that the
ground was not solid beneath, but below yawned a
pitch dark cavern.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Mr. Mennell? What had we better
do?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Mennell came up. “Got a lantern, boys?” he
asked. “Let’s see how deep it is.” They tied a
miner’s lantern on to the end of a red neckerchief and
let it down. “H’m, only about eight feet—during
the blasting the land must have slipped. My God,”
he shouted. “Ropes! Ladders! I’m going
down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s wrong?” asked Ferrers, one of his pals.
“You look as if you have seen a ghost.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mennell wiped the sweat off his forehead. “Look
down there, Ferrers,” said he hoarsely. “Can you
see anything?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ferrers took hold of the lantern and peered down into
the blackness. Then suddenly he stood up and looked
closely into Mennell’s face. “There is something
there,” said he in an awe-struck voice. “Something
that looks like men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You saw too?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, William.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then it was no ghost.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Down the rope ladder went Mennell, followed by
Ferrers. They bent over the inanimate forms of Alan
and Desmond Forsyth and gently carried them up into
the mine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s that?” Ferrers pointed to a far corner
of the cave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a woman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Tenderly also was Jez-Riah carried up the swaying
ladder. The miners were all speechless. How was it
possible for three human beings to have got into such
a position?</p>

<p class='c012'>Reverently they were carried to the office at the
bottom of the shaft where the manager was busy
writing. Mennell told him what had happened, and
the boys were laid side by side upon the floor. But
when they looked at Jez-Riah they could not repress a
shudder. She looked almost inhuman with her purple
skin and protruding horn. They overcame their repugnance,
however, and forced brandy between her parched
lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond opened his eyes first. “Is this Marshfielden?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“It’s all right,” said Mr. Travers, the manager,
kindly, and he offered him some more of the
stimulant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I am alive?” He touched Mr. Travers’
hand. “God, I am among white people at last,” and
he fell back again unconscious.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The doc’s above,” said a man. “I’ve been on the
’phone. Beds are all prepared for them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So the two boys, wrapped in miners’ coats, were
carried out into the sunlight once again. Alan, however,
did not recover consciousness at all. He was
worn out from hunger, fatigue and worry. Always
the one to have a comforting word to cheer his companions,
this last experience had been too much for him
and he lay so still and quiet and cold, they feared it
would be impossible to save him. And Jez-Riah? She
had come to her senses and had called for Alan but the
miners did not understand her, and drew away from
her in fear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What shall we do with—it—her?” asked Mennell
at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take her above and put her in Dr. Mackintosh’s
care,” said Mr. Travers kindly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The day was perfect, the sun shining brightly, the
sky was blue, a transparent blue, and the birds were
singing gaily. The warmth of the sun’s rays came
through the coat that was wrapped round Jez-Riah, and
she struggled to be free of it. The men put her on
the ground, and she stood, hands outstretched and
gazed at the sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jovah. Har-Barim,” she cried, and smiled at the
brightness all around.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly a change came over her features and she
stepped out on to a grassy patch. A crowd of men
watched her, and their expressions showed horror and
intense fear. There was perfect silence for a moment,
and suddenly a voice cried out in tones so hoarse as to
be unrecognizable, “My God” and a man turned and
fled. All the rest of the miners followed him, their
faces white and strained, and little work was done that
day at the mine.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>And in a little saloon near by, half the men were
drinking deeply, drinking to forget the horror they had
just witnessed; and they laughed brazenly and made
coarse jests in their fear, but not one of them spoke to
the other of what he had seen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Nurse Mavis Wylton looked after her patients cheerfully;
she was glad of something to do. Life had been
very dull in the little township and although the advent
of the two Englishmen had made her unaccountably
homesick, it had done a great deal toward breaking the
monotony.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the first year of the Great War she had taken up
nursing, had tended the suffering on the muddy battlefields
of Flanders, had seen service under the scorching
sun of Salonica, had continued her labours in Malta,
Gibraltar and Egypt. She was in Cairo when the
Armistice was signed, and applied for a post in
Australia at the conclusion of the War.</p>

<p class='c012'>An orphan, she had no ties in the dear old Mother
Country; her only brother was sleeping in the company
of thousands of others in the battle-scarred region of
Ypres. She was interested in her two patients—they
had come from the mine in an unaccountable manner:
she heard the story of the strange woman who had
accompanied them and only half believed it—it sounded
so very improbable. How could it be true? What
was it Mr. Travers had said? She remembered his
exact words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nurse, it was horrible,” he told her. “As we
watched, it—the woman’s face—seemed to dry up and
wrinkle until it looked like parchment. The outstretched
arms grew thin and bony; the body trembled
violently and crumpled up and fell to the ground,—and
when I went closer all trace of the woman had vanished
and there was only a little patch of brown dust on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>ground and a little purple package that she had been
wearing fastened to her back.” The nurse could
hardly believe anything so horrible, so uncanny. Yes,
poor Jez-Riah had had her wish. She had seen the
sun, had drunk in God’s pure air. But the atmosphere
was too rare, and she had died. Died? Nay, withered
up, and returned to the dust from which she had
sprung, and nothing remained of the strange, underworld
creature, but a little powdery matter that was
blown away to the four winds of the heaven she had
just existed to see.</p>

<p class='c012'>Both Alan and Desmond lay in a semi-comatose condition
for many days. Their hardships had been so
great, their experiences so terrible, that it was marvellous
that they had returned sane to the upper world.
As it was, both suffered from brain fever, and were
now being nursed back to health and strength. The
crisis over, both boys were on the high road to convalescence.
Side by side in little narrow beds they lay,
and gradually the knowledge of their adventures came
back to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis had just entered the room one day when Alan
broke the silence. “Nurse, what day is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tuesday.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What month, Nurse?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s Tuesday the twenty-fourth of June.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Midsummer day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” she smiled. “Now you mustn’t ask a lot
of questions, but I’ll tell you this—both you and your
friend—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My cousin,” corrected Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, you and your cousin have been very ill.
You were brought here four weeks ago and at first we
despaired of your lives. You are both much better
now, and we hope to have you up very soon. Now
don’t talk any more—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nurse,” he pleaded. “Just one more question.”
He pondered a minute. “It was June at Marshfielden
when—Why it must be 1915!” he finished quickly,
Nurse Wylton frowned. Was this a new form of
delirium?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now don’t ask questions—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Nurse, Nurse—I must know! We’ve been away
a long time. If this is June, then it <i>must</i> be 1915.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are a long way past 1915,” said the nurse
quietly. “This is June, 1920. You must have mistaken
the date.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked at her in blank amazement. “1920,”
he muttered. “Desmond”—hoarsely—“did you hear
that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now don’t talk any more,” commanded the nurse—and
she drew the green blinds across the window,
and shut out the brilliant sunlight.</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as she had gone, Desmond spoke. “Six
years in that Hell! I can’t realize it. Over six years
cut right out of our lives!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know how we are to explain our presence
in the mine,” said Alan thoughtfully. “I don’t think
it will be altogether wise to tell our whole story. I’d
rather Uncle John knew first. He would, perhaps, get
old Sir Christopher Somerville to organize an expedition
to Kalvar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Desmond, “a properly equipped exploring
party would find it comparatively easy to prove the
truth of our story. Why we have made one of the
biggest racial discoveries of the century. Historically
and scientifically we shall have benefited the whole world
by our experience.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor Jez-Riah,” said Alan suddenly. “What an
end!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The first day the boys were coherent, they had asked
about their little purple companion, and it was Nurse
Wylton who had broken the news of her “death.”
The boys had taken it very quietly—and the nurse was
unable to form any ideas on the relation she bore to
them. But they really felt towards her as they would
have done to a domestic animal. They scarcely realized
she was human.</p>

<p class='c012'>In fits and starts the cousins recounted their
adventures to each other—even yet they could scarcely
realize they had come through safely. Daily they both
grew stronger, and the marks of privation and suffering
which had so disfigured their features were nearly
wiped away. They were afraid to cable old Sir John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and tell him of their miraculous escape. “We must
break the news gently to him—for he has mourned us
both, and it may be too much of a shock for him to
learn we are both alive and in Australia,” said
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond chuckled. “Australia! Fancy coming
out at the other end of the world! It’s almost like a
fairy story, isn’t it? Do you remember we wondered
where we should eventually land?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nurse Mavis entered—her arms full of flowers.
“Now,” said she briskly. “There’s too much talking
going on. I am sure you will both overtax your
strength. Besides I have a visitor for you this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A visitor?” echoed both boys.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Mr. Travers, the Mine Manager, is very
anxious to see you, and he wants to return you your
property.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What property?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some packages you had when you—came—in
Walla Balla.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The boys looked at each other blankly. They had
entirely forgotten the papyrus and censer and jewels
they had brought from the Tomb of Korah. They had
been worrying about their financial position, and now,
if the jewels proved to be real, they could raise enough
money and to spare for their expenses and their fares
back to England.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mr. Travers will be here in about half an hour,”
went on the nurse. “Do you feel well enough to be
wheeled out in chairs to the garden?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please,” said Desmond. “I’m sick of this room.”
But they felt very weak as they walked across the
corridor to where the bath chairs were awaiting them
with many comfortable cushions and rugs.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the under nurses wheeled Alan out first, and
as Mavis tucked the rugs round Desmond, he whispered
“Wheel me once round the garden first, Nurse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The hazel eyes smiled down at the blue ones, and a
touch of colour came into the nurse’s pretty cheeks.
Of the two strangers, Desmond was her favourite.
He reminded her of her brother—in many ways he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>so helpless, and she mothered him and cared for him,
until love had overtaken her unawares.</p>

<p class='c012'>She wheeled him along the grassy paths, and he asked
her to stop and pick him a rose, but when she offered it,
he saw only the roses in her cheeks—smelt only the
perfume of her hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mavis, Mavis,” he whispered, “will you come back
to England with us—with me—when we go? It seems
too soon to speak—I’m an old crock—old before my
time—but you have brought me back to life and hope.
I can’t tell you what we have been through, Alan and
I. Some day you shall know the whole story. Meanwhile
may I hope? I love you with my whole soul.
Come back to England with me as my wife!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The hazel eyes grew tender as Mavis bent over the
chair and smoothed the thin hand that lay on the coverlet.
“I do care,” she whispered tremulously. “I
have grown to care a great deal—but are you sure? I
know so little of you both. I realize you have been
through some terrible experiences. I won’t question
you, I will trust you, but isn’t it wiser to wait? Wait
until you are stronger. Perhaps in England there was
a girl once,” the pretty lips trembled, “a girl you once
cared for. She may be waiting still—but you have been
ill, and have forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Desmond firmly. “There has never been
a woman in my life. I swear it—never.” Suddenly, as
he spoke, there came before his eyes the picture of a
purple woman leaping into the flames—Kaweeka.
“My God!” he cried, “listen, Mavis! I’m not
worthy of you. One day I will tell you everything. It
is true there was a woman once—” Mavis stifled a cry.
“Listen. She wasn’t a woman of this world, but like
Jez-Riah, the woman who was with us when we came
here. I did not love her—I think I loathed her, but she
was like a siren. She exercised an unholy power over
me. Mavis—she asked me to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you?” in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>A flush of shame came over the white face. “Yes,
Mavis,” hoarsely. “For weeks I lived in her house—until
my cousin found me. When he appeared she did
her best to woo him also. She cast me aside, but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>was strong where I had been weak. No overture she
made was strong enough to tempt him. He it was
who brought me to my senses and saved me from everlasting
shame.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You loved her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! A thousand times no! Mavis—it’s difficult
to explain. Our whole story is so improbable, so
fantastic, that without certain undeniable proofs which
we hold, it would be considered as the phantasy of a
disordered brain. This woman was nothing to me
really; when we were together I loathed and hated her—almost
feared her, but I was clay in her hands. It
was a difficult situation—at that time I did not understand
her language or the ways of her people. Oh,
how can I make you understand! She wanted me as
a new kind of toy. She knew nothing of morality
or life as we know it. Her power was almost
mesmeric.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is she living still?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. She died—oh, years ago,” passing his hand
wearily across his brow. “I am sorry, Mavis. I had
forgotten. I had no right to speak to you, but all
recollection of Kaweeka had faded from my mind until
you spoke of another woman. Will you forget what I
said? I beg of you, don’t despise me too much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear—I hardly know what to say. I forgive you
freely. I nursed you back to life, Desmond. I devoted
my whole time to you. While Matron and Nurse Fanshaw
attended to your cousin, I watched over you.
You grew dear to me. I wanted to see your eyes look
at me with recognition in them. I—I—wanted you to—to
like me—a little. Then when you first became
convalescent I loved to talk to you. Dear, I can forget
the past. Life since 1914 has changed. Women have
changed. We are no longer the narrow minded stay-at-homes
we were before the War.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The War?” asked Desmond wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, the Great War. The war with Germany.”
He looked puzzled, but asked no questions, only lay
back with his eyes closed, thinking. “We understand
the temptations of sex,” she went on, “and can forgive.
You asked me just now to marry you. I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>marry you most gladly whenever you like, and I’ll do
my best to make you forget your terrible experiences.
Wait—” as Desmond would have spoken, “I’ll ask no
questions. When the time is ripe you can tell me all.
Meanwhile I’ll be content to love and trust.” There
was no one in sight; a tall hedge on either side of the
garden walk gave them shelter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Kiss me, Mavis,” said Desmond hoarsely. “Oh
my darling, how I love you.” And so the old, old
story was told once more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nurse Wylton! Nurse Wylton!” Matron’s
voice was calling and it was a rosy cheeked nurse who
answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nurse, wherever have you been? Mr. Travers has
been waiting over half an hour to see the patients.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Half an hour! Mavis offered no excuse—indeed she
had none, and she wheeled her charge to Alan’s side.
As she turned away to fetch Mr. Travers, she heard
Alan say petulantly, “Wherever have you been all this
time, Dez?” but she didn’t catch Desmond’s reply.
If she had it would have set her thinking, for he said
in an awe-struck tone, “Lanny, old boy, do you know
there has been a war—a war with Germany? And
we’ve missed it, old chap, we’ve missed it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Travers was a genial soul and loved by all the
miners. He came forward and greeted the boys
cheerily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I’m glad to hear you are both better. A
nice fright you gave every one to be sure. We
wondered at first how you had got into such a
position.” He laughed heartily at the recollection.</p>

<p class='c012'>“However, the explanation was quite simple after
all, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cousins looked at one another with questioning
eyes. In their opinion the explanation could hardly
be called simple! Mr. Travers, however, went on.
“After you had been rescued, Mennell, our foreman,
gave orders for the men to cease work at that point.
He wanted investigations to be made, after consulting
me. The following day, however, we found the cave
had filled with water, and the pumps were kept very
busy, I can tell you. Then part of the flooring caved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>in, and the walls gave way. Oh, it was a horrid
mess! However, it was eventually cleared away,
and we discovered the subterranean passage. Very
ingenious indeed.” And he rubbed his hands together.
The boys were frankly puzzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When did you leave Karragua?” asked Mr.
Travers suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Karragua?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Karragua.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond opened his mouth as if about to speak, but
Alan was the first to recover his wits.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Before we tell you our story, won’t you tell us
what you discovered?” he asked shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly, my friend. I suppose it was some bet
you had on?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Something of the sort,” agreed Alan, now wholly
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought so. I knew I was right. I shall take a
bottle of rum off Old Man Paterson now. I told him
it was the result of some freakish wager—he would have
it you had discovered it by accident.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do go on,” urged Alan. The situation was becoming
desperate. Neither of the boys had the slightest
idea of what Mr. Travers was talking about.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” continued the cheery manager, “you may
be sure it took some time to clear away the débris after
the cave-in. When it was clear we saw a passage leading
out of it, and followed it about a mile, when it
became choked up; and as we had made no preparations
we returned and decided to continue our investigations
another day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?” from both boys.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a Thursday. John Cornlake, Bill Watson
and one or two other good, all round pick hands came
with Mennell and me. It was a long road—two and
three quarter miles by our pedometer—pitch dark, as
you know. Suddenly we saw a speck of blue in the
distance. We moved the boulder aside—how cleverly
it is hidden among the rocks and undergrowth! and
we realized at once it was the exit of ‘Red Mark’s
Tunnel’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Neither of the boys spoke—they saw the humour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the situation, but were afraid lest by a word they might
give themselves away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be a hundred and twenty years since it was
used. How did you come to discover it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A fellow told us about it,” said Alan vaguely after
the fraction of a pause, and Mr. Travers was content.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course when the shaft of our mine was sunk,
the workmen searched for the entrance to the tunnel,
but it was never discovered, and I don’t suppose it ever
would have been except by a lucky accident. I suppose
you were unable to find your way back to Karragua—was
that it? You were in a pretty bad condition when
you were found. We have already informed the
government of the discovery,” he went on, “and agents
have been sent down to inspect it. We are not sure
what the result will be. Every one in Walla Balla
wants to have it opened up as a sort of showplace. It
would certainly do the township an immense amount
of good. Red Mark and his fellow convicts who
escaped through it have certainly left a wonderful
monument behind them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So! It flashed on Alan’s mind at once. In some
miraculous way the entrance to the passage by which
they had come from Korah’s tomb was again blocked
up. Their secret was still their own, but a subterranean
passage made by early eighteenth century convicts had
been unearthed instead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did Red Mark dig the passage himself?” asked
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The story goes that Red Mark and a fellow convict
escaped and commenced a passage. Walla Balla was a
large farm estate at that time, and was employing nearly
sixty convicts. Escape was almost impossible, the place
was so well guarded, and such brutal treatment was
inflicted on those that attempted to escape that few
tried. Red Mark and his companion were lucky, however,
and they managed to elude the bloodhounds.
Their friends helped them with food. Feverishly they
worked at the tunnel. It was their plan to burrow to
the sea. It took them several years to complete it,
but they accomplished their stupendous task at last.
The night it was finished fifty convicts vanished. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>had ransacked the larders and had taken plenty of food
with them. Those that were left talked vaguely about
having heard of a subterranean passage, but it was
never found—at least not until now. Those convicts
were never seen again. But at Karragua Creek a small
sailing craft disappeared, and on it doubtless went Red
Mark and his friends. But of course you’ve heard
the story before. How did you find the place—by
accident? And then I suppose you wagered you’d find
your way through to the other end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan smiled. Mr. Travers was extremely helpful.
He talked so much himself that he gave no one else
the chance of speaking, and he considerately answered
all the questions that he put to the boys—himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Desmond, who had taken his cue from
his cousin. “We told a friend about it, who wagered
us one thousand pounds we would find our way
through. Unfortunately, our lanterns went out, we
lost our way, we had no food and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I suppose you were a week or more in that
cave—hungry and worn out?” finished Mr. Travers
helpfully. “Now I’ve brought you your property
back,” and he handed them the packages they had
brought from the Tomb of Korah. “Oh, you might
give me an official receipt for them,” and he handed
the boys a paper for them to sign. “By the way,” he
continued, as he put the receipt away, “that woman.”
His genial face grew solemn. “What was it—? Was
it some—some joke you had prepared, or was it—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t explain yet,” said Alan shortly. “We are
going home to England where we have a very strange
story to tell. I cannot explain the phenomenon you
saw, but I may have to call upon you to repeat the story
of her death. I suppose I may use your name?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By all means. I shall be only too pleased to assist
you young gentlemen in every way I can, but I shall be
glad to hear about that woman—it was damned strange.
By the way, I sealed your parcels with our office seal.
I should like you to examine them to see they are
intact.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We won’t bother now, Mr. Travers, thank you.
We have absolute confidence in you. By the way,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>added, as if in afterthought, “could you put me in touch
with any one who would buy one or two unset gems?
I have some with me, and am anxious to convert them
into cash for our immediate use.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s easily done,” said Mr. Travers. “Our
general manager is connected with Messrs. Frimpton,
Long and Beauchamp of Melbourne. They are, I
think, the biggest dealers in gold and precious stones
in Australia. I will get an introduction for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks very much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t mention it. Now I think I have stayed quite
long enough for a first visit. Good-bye, Mr. Forsyth.
Good-bye, Mr. Desmond. Take care of yourselves,
and don’t get over tired,” and the kindly man left them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We got out of that pretty easily, thanks to you,”
said Desmond as they saw him disappear down a bend in
the garden. “I couldn’t think what he was driving at.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s extremely lucky the way to Korah’s tomb has
been hidden again. That heavy fall of rock and earth did
us a good turn.” Alan remained silent a few minutes,
and looked at his cousin quizzically. Then quietly—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Haven’t you anything to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh my dear chap—don’t think I am merely
inquisitive, but we’ve been like brothers all our lives.
I’ve watched our pretty nurse; I’ve watched you too.
Have you spoken?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. My God, Alan! I’m not worthy. Think—Kaweeka—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is past. It’s no good worrying over what is
done. You were not responsible down there, alone, in
that Hell. Have you told Mavis about it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve tried to make her understand about Kaweeka—but
I’ve told her nothing about our adventures and
our discoveries.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad of that. I should like Uncle John to be
at the first telling of our experiences. I’m glad about
Mavis for your sake. I like her very much—in fact I
might say I’ve grown to be almost fond of her. All
happiness, old boy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should like to be married before we start for
England.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Will she agree?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well I’ll be best man. Ah, Mavis”—as she
appeared—“there is to be no formality now, you know.
You are going to marry one of the best, and you’ve
got to like me too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis bent down and kissed his cheek. “There!
Alan, see how cousinly I can be,” said she laughingly.
“Now it’s time you both went to bed—you’ve been
up quite long enough for one day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That night before the lights were extinguished she
told them the story of the Great War. “Where have
you been?” she asked in bewilderment. “Why every
one in the world knows of it. It’s been horrible—terrible;
white fighting against white; white employing
black to help them. Every nation in the world suffered
in one way or another.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know it sounds improbable, dear, but neither
Alan nor I knew the long talked of war with Germany
had really come to pass until you spoke of it to-day.
Don’t ask any questions—just trust me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all very mysterious and strange,” said she
ruefully. “But I will possess my soul in patience.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as he was able, Alan sent one magnificent
diamond and half a dozen emeralds to Messrs. Frimpton,
Long and Beauchamp and received in return banknotes
to the value of five thousand pounds. The boys had
also chosen some diamonds for Mavis, and had had
them set into an engagement ring for the woman
Desmond loved.</p>

<p class='c012'>Already they were well enough to leave the hospital,
but as Walla Balla was only a very small mining township,
there was no accommodation for visitors, so the
cousins remained at the hospital as paying guests.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day, late in July, a very pretty wedding took
place. The bride was dressed in her nurse’s uniform
and the bridegroom and best man were arrayed in unconventional
white duck. The ceremony was performed
by the local clergyman, and there was a big
spread afterwards at the hospital, to which everybody
in the township had been invited.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan felt rather sad as he stood waiting on the platform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>for the train to come in that would carry off the
happy pair to their honeymoon. No woman had ever
entered his life. His great ideal was a dream still; and
he wondered if the time had passed for her ever to
materialize.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll arrange for everything, won’t you?” said
Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rather. Now don’t worry. The boat leaves
Sydney at noon on the seventh of next month—eleven
days from now. It’s the Clan Ronald. I’ll book your
berths and await you there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Their farewells were said, and Alan was left alone.
He stayed a few days longer at Walla Balla among the
friends he had made, and then travelled by easy stages
to Sydney. The country was very beautiful but he
longed to get home. He longed to see the smoky
chimneys of London, the bustling streets, to hear again
the noisy traffic, and at last to enjoy the truly rural
beauty of the English lanes and woods. He longed to
see his uncle. Was he still alive? he wondered. He
was afraid to cable; he was afraid to write. Suddenly
an idea came into his head and he wondered why he
had not thought of it before. He would write to his
uncle’s confidential clerk and friend—Masters. He
could trust him to break the news gently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There! I think that will meet the case,” and Alan
fastened up the letter and posted it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The seventh at last! All the luggage was on board;
Desmond and his wife drove up radiantly happy to the
quay and waved excitedly as they saw Alan leaning
over the bulwarks. The bell clanged, the sailors gave
vent to their sonorous cry, “All ashore! All
ashore!” The siren sounded. Gradually the great
vessel glided away; the smoke belched out in volumes
from her funnels; the landing stage grew smaller and
smaller until it was out of sight altogether. The vessel
had started on her journey to England.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night after dinner, when Mavis had gone to
her state-room, the two cousins had a heart to heart
talk in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems impossible we are really going home at
last,” said Desmond. “I feel like a child again. I
have so much to learn. When we disappeared aeroplanes
were only beginning to be used—now they are
almost perfect, and are vehicles of every day use. The
whole world seems to have progressed a century in
these last few years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There certainly is a great deal for us to learn,”
agreed Alan, “but we must leave it to Uncle John.
He will put us right about everything.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder how he has progressed with his airship,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>said Desmond after a pause. “We used to laugh at
the dear old chap; he has the laugh on us now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He always said that the future of commerce was in
the air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you the papyrus safe?” asked Desmond
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan laughed. “Rather! Or at least the Purser
has. I bought a strong deed box in Sydney and packed
everything in it; here’s the key. When next we open
it, please God, it will be in the presence of Uncle John.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked sadly at the scene in front of him. A
brilliant moon had risen and was sending its beams
across the phosphorescent waters. The air was sweet
and balmy—the Southern Cross was discernible and the
whole scene was like a wonderful painting. The chud-chud
of the engines and the swish of the water was the
only sound to be heard. Somehow, Alan felt very much
alone that night. Desmond, his childish playmate, his
boyhood’s chum, and later his companion in adventure,
seemed lost to him. He had married a wife. That
was the trouble in a nut-shell. Things would never be
the same again. He was fond of Mavis—she was a
dear girl, and would be a splendid wife for his cousin—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good night, old chap,” said he huskily. “I’m
tired. I’m going to bed. I’ve been keeping you too
long from Mavis.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good night, Alan. I think I will turn in now. I
shall tumble to sleep as soon as my head touches the
pillow,” he added boyishly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was early morning before Alan went to sleep.
He wondered what the future had in store for him.
Would it prove as adventurous as the past? Or would
he remain a lonely old bachelor, a wanderer on the face
of the earth? No fixed home of his own—a favourite
uncle, perhaps, to Desmond’s sons. Yes, he was
getting morbid. He was still young, barely thirty and
had his life before him. Somewhere, perhaps, a mate
was waiting for him. Somewhere, some time he would
find his ideal,—and then—</p>

<p class='c012'>The clock struck five; he yawned, turned over and
fell asleep.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>HOME AGAIN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In a lovely part of Perthshire, deep in a valley among
the mountains, lonely and hard of access, stood a
curious building. Any one with a knowledge of
aeronautics would have recognized it as a hangar for
an airship. A narrow track led from it to a tiny
cottage in which lived three men—Sir John Forsyth,
Abel Masters and Hector Murdoch, the latter a trusty
and faithful mechanic. Shortly after Alan’s supposed
death, Sir John gave up everything to the last
remaining object of his life—the completion and
success of his giant airship. He had grown very
secretive about it. He had it dismantled and taken to
pieces, and in pieces it was sent to Scotland to await
further experiments. A hangar had been built, the
workmen had gone—and then the three men set to
work to build up the “Argenta” once again. Sir
John had disposed of his interest in the Marshfielden
collieries, and his London offices had been taken over
by the new owners, hence he had no tie to keep him
in the great metropolis.</p>

<p class='c012'>For over five years he had worked, and now success
had come. The powerful spirit he had perfected as a
motive power was unexcelled and on the morrow they
were going for their first trial flight in the great
machine.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John rubbed his hand affectionately over the
shimmering metal. It meant everything to him since
his nephews had gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s beautiful, Masters!” said he, and there was
a note of triumph in his voice. “It’s perfect.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Yes, sir. Three hundred miles an hour we ought
to do comfortably, that is the minimum, and from four
hundred and fifty to five hundred at express speed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve worked with me very faithfully, Masters.
It was good of you to pander to the whim of an old
man, and bury yourself up here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was only too glad to come, Sir John,” answered
Masters. “For forty-five years I worked in your
office—your father’s it was then, sir. I was the first
to congratulate him after Victoria, God bless her, had
made him a baronet. For over twenty years I was
your confidential servant—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friend! Masters, friend!” gently corrected Sir
John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, friend, if I may say so. I was always
interested in electricity and mechanics, and when you
started experimenting, it was me you asked to help
you. I have never forgotten that, Sir John, and now
I am proud to have been the one to see the work of
years rewarded by such success.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Hector this morning?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has motored to Arroch Head for the letters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it the day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Sir John, it’s Friday.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, of course, so it is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Since Sir John had been living at Dalmyrnie, no
one had his address except the Poste Restante at
Arroch Head—the nearest village fourteen miles away.
No persuasion was strong enough to make him reveal
his hiding place. He seemed to live in dread of his
secret being snatched from him. No precaution was
too great to take to prevent such a catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lunch is ready, Sir John,” came a voice from
behind him. It was Hector who had returned. The
three men all had meals together in the little
honeysuckle-covered cottage that had once been a
gamekeeper’s. There was no ceremony—they were all
workers together.</p>

<p class='c012'>The leather Post Office bag was on the table, and
Sir John unlocked it with the key that hung so
prominently on the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a budget,” said he testily. “Why do people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>bother me?” He began to sort the letters. “One
from Freemantle and Goddard—their account, I
suppose. That’s from Armstrong’s with their invoice
for those aluminium screws. A wire for you,” tossing
the little orange envelope across to Masters.</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters picked it up gingerly. “Who ever can it
be from? Oh,” as he read it. “I don’t understand it.
I think it must be meant for you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John looked up. “Why?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was handed in at noon yesterday at Plymouth.
It was redirected on from the old London offices. It
says, ‘Landed quite safely. Leaving Plymouth this
morning. Arrive Paddington 5:20. Will come
straight to you. Forsyth.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forsyth!” repeated Sir John. “Who on earth
can it be? And if it’s for me, why did they address
it to you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t understand it at all, sir,” said Masters.
“Haven’t you a cousin—Dr. Forsyth who went to
Canada some years ago?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes! Malcolm Forsyth! Of course, of
course. Well, I can’t see him. I won’t see him. I
don’t want to see anyone. But why did he wire you,
Masters? He didn’t even know your name.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t understand it at all, Sir John,” then his
face brightened, “unless the clerk who redirected it
put my name on by mistake.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, perhaps that was it. Oh well, never mind,”
said Sir John testily. “You must write and say I
can’t see him. Here’s a letter for you, too,” he
went on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I expect it’s from the Stores,” said Masters. “I
have been expecting their list of concentrated foods
with the highest caloric value. We want them in our
flights.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He opened the letter casually. “My God!” he
cried and it dropped from his nerveless fingers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For Heaven’s sake control yourself,” said Sir
John sharply. Now his airship was complete, his
nerves were all on edge waiting for the trial. “What
is it? What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sorry,” said Masters penitently, “but I’ve had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>a shock. I’ve heard from some one I thought was
dead years ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John showed little interest. “Well let us now
get on with lunch,” was all he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think I’ll have any if you don’t mind,”
said Masters. “I must go into Arroch Head at once
and send a telegram. I may have the car I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, of course, but do have your meal first.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—no I can’t wait. I must go at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters had had a shock. He had received Alan’s
letter from Sydney, and the meaning of the telegram
was clear. Alan and Desmond were safe and had
arrived in England. He must wire them at once, and
give them Sir John’s address. He scarcely knew how
to break the news to him, and it worried him as he
went into the little village.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you wired your friend?” asked Sir John
when he got back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you want to see him—if so you had better take
a short holiday after the trial.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you all the same, Sir John, but I’ve wired
them to come to Arroch Head.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The devil you have!” roared Sir John. “I
suppose the next thing will be that you want them to
come over here and see the Argenta.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was going to suggest it to you,” answered
Masters imperturbably.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you taken leave of your senses? Show
my work—the child of my brain to strangers?
Never!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are not quite strangers, Sir John. The fact
is—” he hesitated, “I told you I had mourned them
as dead—so have <i>you</i>, Sir John.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have given them your address and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve given them my address?” spluttered the
old gentleman in rage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Sir John—don’t you understand now? I
told you that <i>you too</i> had mourned them as dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John looked sharply at Masters, and as he gazed
deep into his eyes he read there the truth. “Alan—Desmond,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>he said hoarsely. Masters nodded his
head and Sir John sank back into his chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alan!” he whispered. “Is it true?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t joke, man, for God’s sake! Don’t fool
me! It can’t be true. It’s six years since the accident.
Why the mine has never been in use since—not that
part.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you understand the telegram now, sir?”
Masters held it out. “They have been away, but now
they are back in England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was that the letter this morning?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes! Read it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John was plainly overcome. “I’m sure it’s a
joke,” he muttered over and over again. “It can’t
be true. The thing’s impossible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All that day work was at a standstill. Hector alone
saw to the bodily requirements of the men, and meals
as usual were served at their proper times.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They will be here for the trial,” whispered Sir
John excitedly. “Oh my God!” and the old man
burst into tears. His grief at the loss of his two
nephews had been so great, his affection for them so
sincere that he could scarcely realize that in some
miraculous way they still lived.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you meet the train?” asked Masters as they
retired for the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes! Yes! Of course! Take the large car.
Are you sure everything is ready for them? You see
there will be a lady, too. Desmond’s wife—my niece.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything is quite all right. We have made the
place quite comfortable—we will occupy the two
rooms there, and that will leave three bedrooms in the
cottage free. Yours, Mr. Alan’s, and the largest, at
the front, for Mr. Desmond and his wife.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Splendid, Masters, splendid.” It was a glorious,
late September morning when the Scotch express
steamed in. Alan was out of the train first.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle,” said he, “dear old uncle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My boy—my boy! How are you? Oh, how
you have changed! Desmond, my boy, welcome
home!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“This is Mavis, Uncle John.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John held her by the shoulders and looked into
her eyes. She could see that suffering had left its
mark on the old man’s face, so she impetuously flung
her arm round his neck and kissed him. “Uncle
John,” she whispered. “I’ve heard so much about
you from Desmond and Alan. I’ve been just longing
to come home—to you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a very merry party that drove home to
Dalmyrnie.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eat your breakfasts,” commanded Uncle John.
“You shall tell me your story afterwards. But have
a good meal first.” After breakfast, they sat in the
old-world garden, among the trees—Sir John and
Masters, the two boys and Mavis, and their wonderful
story was told.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond began by telling how he was caught by
the Light, omitting nothing, and Alan concluded the
story. “Now here is the papyrus and here are the
jewels and the censer. These, I think, will prove the
truth of our strange story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you mean to say there is a race of people
living in the centre of the Earth?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, indeed, where we have been actually living
for the past few years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are actually descended from Korah, Abiram
and Dathan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, as I told you, they still speak a patois Hebrew—they
possess a copy of part of the Pentateuch—they
worship the God of the old Testament, Jehovah, the
great ‘I am’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet you say they are savage?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think my description can be good, if I
left you with that impression,” said Alan thoughtfully.
“They are not like the black, savage natives of the
present day. I should say rather, that they still
possess the savage instincts of our forefathers. The
sacrifice of living creatures, even humanity, does not
revolt them. They are impervious to great pain
themselves, and can watch it in others without flinching.
The living sacrifices they offered to the Fire must
have suffered agonies before life was finally extinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>in them; but to their mind the pain they were inflicting
made the sacrifice still more acceptable to their
Almighty. They inflicted terrible tortures on their
Virgin Watchers of the Temple—they were cruel,
cunning, vile—yet in other ways they were too cultured
to be called savages. Savage yes, but not savages.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see the difference you mean, my boy. But didn’t
you say they worshipped the Fire?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. It is itself a part of their religion. I don’t
think I ever understood it properly myself. They
looked on the Fire almost as God himself—not
a different God, but just God. Yet at the same time
they believed that the God of their Fathers exists in
the Heaven above the Upper World. It sounds very
complicated, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no, my boy. I understand quite well what
you mean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They believed they had to offer living sacrifices
to the Fire to keep it burning. The strangest part of
their belief is, that when the Fire does die out, then
will come the consummation of the entire world—not
only theirs but ours too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then they know of our world?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh yes. Dathan and Abiram left written histories
about the world they had left—the world they had
once inhabited.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Going back to the Fire,” said Sir John. “Is it
large?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Enormous. We never saw it in its entirety. It
seemed to stretch away into the distance for miles. It
was walled in with a glass-like substance, and was
absolutely unlike any fire we had ever seen before. It
seemed to have no real substance—was all leaping,
brilliant flames—yet the heart of it seemed solid and
firm. During our stay we could see that the Fire was
really growing less and less. Imperceptibly at first,
but latterly by leaps and bounds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wonder what <i>will</i> happen when the Fire does
go out,” said Desmond thoughtfully. “It has existed
on itself for these thousands of years. The only
fuel that was ever given it latterly was human or
animal life. Surely that could hardly feed a Fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“I think some world-wide catastrophe will come
when the Fire dies out, if ever it does,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Jez-Riah just fell to dust,” went on Sir John
slowly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis was very excited. “Why our fortunes are
made,” she cried. “Of course you’ll write to the
papers?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We didn’t know what to do,” said Alan. “Desmond
and I talked it over and came to the conclusion
we would tell Uncle John first and get his advice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No one else knows at all?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No one but us five.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters looked up and gave Alan a grateful look.
“It was good of you to include me,” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, you are part and parcel of ourselves,
Masters,” laughed Alan. “Nothing would be complete
without you,” and he shook hands heartily with
his uncle’s trusty friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must go back to London,” said Sir John at
last. “I will wire Sir Christopher Somerville—he’s
President of the Geographical Research Society you
know—and Professor Chard of the Geological Society
to meet us in town. I will put the whole matter before
them and take their advice. But, my dear boys, I
can scarcely yet realize I have you back with me
again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you done any more with your Argenta?”
asked Desmond suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John’s eyes shone. “Come with me,” said he
and he took them to the hangar. “She is complete
and I think perfect,” said he simply. Very beautiful
indeed looked the Argenta. There was a perfect
grassy incline leading from the hangar to a large,
flat field.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall run her down the slope,” he explained,
“and the field in the hollow is splendid for both
ascending and descending.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you tried her yet?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. We were going to try her yesterday, Mr.
Alan,” said Masters, “but Sir John postponed it until
your arrival.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“And we must postpone it again, I am afraid,”
said Sir John, rather sadly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it necessary, Uncle John?” asked Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think so, my dear. Your story is too wonderful
to keep back a moment longer than is necessary.
We will go to London to-morrow, and after all
formalities are done with, will come back, try the
Argenta, and if she is as I think she is, we will go for
a long holiday in her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall I accompany you?” asked Masters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just as you like,” answered Sir John. “Come
with us by all means, or stay with Hector and watch
over the Argenta.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would rather stay here, sir, if you have no
objection. I’ve no ties that take me back to town,
and I would rather remain by the Argenta.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Forty-eight hours later Sir John, Alan, and Desmond
and his wife arrived in London. Sir John had let
his town house, so they chose a quiet hotel at the
back of Berkeley Square for their domicile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir Christopher Somerville and Professor Chard
kept the appointment made, and once again the boys
recounted their adventures. “Wonderful! Marvellous!
Miraculous!” the professors kept muttering
to themselves, as the improbable story was unfolded
to them, piece by piece.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said Sir John, when it was at last told.
“There are seven people only that have heard this
story. What do you advise us to do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will see the Home Secretary,” said Sir
Christopher at last. “This is a Government affair,
of course. England’s to the fore again; lucky they
found their way out on British territory. The
question will be brought up in the House—an
expedition must be formed, and the two young
gentlemen would probably like to accompany us, and
help us with their knowledge of the place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t go again,” cried Mavis, her face blanching.
“Oh you wouldn’t take him from me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be afraid,” said Alan kindly. “Nothing
is done yet, and when it is they will be probably quite
contented with me alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Would you go again?” eyes wide open in horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, Mavis, but I’ll see that Desmond
doesn’t go,” and he laughed cheerily.</p>

<p class='c012'>The professors called a general meeting of their
associations upon the matter of “THE DISCOVERY
OF A NEW AND HITHERTO UNSUSPECTED
PEOPLE” and the two boys came in for a great deal
of congratulation and applause. Everything was
settled at last, however; matters were directed through
the right channel and a statement was brought up in
the House of Commons. The only point that was not
made public was the exact place of the entrance to
Kalvar. That was kept entirely secret—the Home
Secretary having pledged his word that until the
necessary arrangements had been made between the
two Governments, that of the Mother Country,
together with the Commonwealth of Australia, most
stringent secrecy should be kept, so that no one could
possibly know that Walla Balla was the favoured spot.</p>

<p class='c012'>All the papers were full of the new discovery.
Reporters, ordinary newspaper men, big newspaper
correspondents, all found their way to the little hotel.
Alan and Desmond Forsyth had become famous!
Kings and princes,—commoners and dukes, all vied
with one another to meet and entertain the two men
who had had such remarkable experiences.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last the expedition was complete and was due
to sail in a fortnight’s time. Meanwhile, Alan, who
was to accompany it, was to take a fortnight’s entire
rest. Geologists, historians, geographers, all wanted
representatives sent. Mechanics, electricians and a
small armed force had to be provided. The Government
had already made a large grant to the Mining
Company at Walla Balla, and had the entire rights for
excavating a mile each way from the Second Pit.</p>

<p class='c012'>The whole expedition was a voluntary one, and
once again Britain and her Colonies came to the fore
as the greatest pioneers in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>The golden censer had been offered to the British
Museum, and had been gratefully accepted. The
papyrus had been placed in the hands of experts who
pronounced the document to be genuine. Antiquarians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>from all parts of the world came to see the
relics, and the newspapers had paragraphs in them
every day, relating to the “Kalvar Expedition.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Phew!” said Alan one day as he leant back in
a taxi. “That is the last public speech I shall make
for months, I hope.” He and Desmond had been
guests of honour at a luncheon given by the Society
of Antiquarians. “Thank goodness we leave
to-night for Scotland. To-morrow we shall see the
Argenta. Nine months since we were there. What
a lot we have crowded into our lives these last few
months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think we’ve made up for our lost six years,”
laughed Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters met them at Arroch Head and was frankly
glad to welcome them back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nine months since we were here,” said Sir John.
“You’ve seen the news in the papers, of course?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, Sir John. The <i>Cavalier</i> sails in a
fortnight, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” answered Alan, “and I am going to take
fourteen days real rest, and then—well, off to Kalvar
again, only this time of my own free will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The longed-for moment had come! Hector was in
the mechanic’s seat, while Masters navigated the
great ship down the grassy slope. Gracefully she
slid out of the hangar, and down the incline and
stopped on the level. Sir John was very excited.
“You are sure you want to test her?” he asked.
“Remember she has never been up before—you have
only my word for it that she’s safe. Desmond, don’t
you think you had better stay with Mavis, in case—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Mavis interposed. “Nonsense, Uncle John.
This is <i>the</i> day of my life. Now give me your hand,”
and she gracefully swung herself up the ladder and
on to the lower deck. Sir John followed suit, and
they stood side by side, watching the cousins ascend
the ladder.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last! They were all aboard and the six persons
entrusted themselves to the aluminium bird that shone
brightly in the sunshine. They hauled the grappling
irons in, Masters touched a lever, and they started.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Slowly they ascended at first—but climbed higher and
higher, faster and faster until the hangar was lost to
sight and they saw only broad expanses of country
below them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” said Mavis breathlessly. “We’re off.
Where are we going?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want to make a circuit of the British Isles, and
then home to Dalmyrnie.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But shall we have time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At express speed we ought to do it in about four
hours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only four hours?” in amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we shall only go from Dalmyrnie—we
shan’t touch further north to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” went on Mavis impatiently. “I want you
to take me all over this wonderful ship. I want to
see everything. I want to know how it is possible to
navigate and propel such a tremendous vessel by the
work of only two men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we’ll start right now,” laughed Sir John.
“Come, boys, we’ll explore the Argenta, and then
have some tea.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE AIRSHIP</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“It’s wonderful, Uncle John! It’s almost beyond
belief!” Mavis had walked the whole length of the
vessel on the under deck in silence. Her husband’s
arm was about her waist, her face was radiant, flushed
with excitement. Alan, too, was bereft of words; even
his wildest dreams had never imagined a vessel so
perfect, so magnificent, so sensitive to touch that two
men could manage it with comfort and ease, and should
necessity arise, even one man could manipulate the tiny
levers and navigate it.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a torpedo body some nine hundred feet long,
its nose narrowed to three feet, giving it a grace
unusual in such a monster aircraft. The entire body
was composed of an alloy of aluminium, the formula
of which was discovered by much hard work and
research by Sir John and Masters. An upper and lower
deck ran round the entire ship, about six feet wide,
which was covered with a fibre, and had bulwarks of
aluminium.</p>

<p class='c012'>At intervals round the deck, hatches were open, leading
to the hold, which contained the tank for the
reserve propelling spirit, the water-tank, larders and cold
storage. Three ladders on each side and one at either
end led to the upper deck. The bow of the vessel was
covered with a kind of thick glass and formed a comfortable
smoking room where one could sit in comfort
in wet or windy weather and gaze into space. There
was a dining room, a drawing room, and five bedrooms;
all most beautifully upholstered and furnished with the
maximum of comfort. The inside walls were polished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>like burnished silver, and the windows of the same thick
glass were hung with pale blue silk to match the
upholstery. There was everything for use and comfort;
telephonic communication from every room to
every part of the ship—electric light—electric fans—electric
stoves—a pianola and there was even a gramophone
on board.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John had also remembered a good library of
books, novels and serious works, and a wonderful
supply of writing materials.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, you have forgotten nothing,” said Mavis.
“Uncle John, I think you have been wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the kitchens furnished Mavis with most
interest. They were so well planned out. In one
corner stood an electric cooking stove, and on the wall
hung everything necessary for the success of the
culinary art. A pipe led from the water tank to the
kitchen and there was a very ingenious arrangement by
which all waste matter was emptied into an electrically
heated tank which reduced everything first to a pulp
and then to steam, which escaped through a pipe to the
outer side of the ship.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How much water can we carry?” asked Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, in cubic feet, my dear—” commenced Sir
John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! no! Uncle John! I don’t understand cubic
feet. Tell me how long our water would last.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With the utmost care we can carry enough water
to last six people two months.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As long as that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and then, should any unforeseen circumstances
arise, by which we were unable to renew our water
supply, I could fall back on a wonderful discovery I
have made. See, my dear.” and he opened a small
press. There, on shelves, were packed row upon row
of transparent blocks, perhaps an inch square.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What ever is it?” said Mavis, laughing. “Why,
it’s camphor!” Alan picked a piece up and examined
it. It was certainly like camphor to look at,
but was odourless and of an intense coldness. “It’s
done me. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John made no reply but took from a little stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>a small electric heater. Upon this he placed a quart
metal bowl, into which he put the little cube. “Very
gentle heat at first, my dears,” said he. “Ah!” as it
began to melt. “Now I think it’s safe to put on full
pressure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Fascinated, they watched until the vessel became full
of a sparkling, bubbling liquid. Turning on another
electric switch, he plunged a metal needle into the
fluid. It belched forth a cloud of steam, hissed
violently and then calmed down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What ever is it?” asked Mavis. For answer, Sir
John poured the liquid into three glasses and handed
one to each.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Try it,” he suggested. “It’s quite cold. That
was an electric needle which generates a coldness below
freezing point.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Another invention?” this from Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There’s no smell,” said Mavis, as she delicately
wrinkled her pretty nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And no taste,” averred Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It reminds me of something,” said Desmond.
“I’m sure I’ve tasted something like it before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it, Uncle John? Do tell us,” pleaded
Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John laughed. “Water, my dear, just plain
water. Desmond is quite right, he has tasted it
before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Water,” said Alan in bewilderment, “but surely
frozen water has a greater bulk than when it is in a
liquid form?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So it has, my boy. But I call this ‘concentrated
essence of water.’ There is enough in that cupboard to
last eighteen months. Of course we should never want
such a quantity, but the experiments pleased and
cheered an old man in his loneliness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He then opened another press and showed that it was
packed with concentrated tea, concentrated essence of
beef and chicken, concentrated essence of milk; it had
everything in it that had been devised for reducing food
bulk to the minimum with a maximum amount of caloric
value.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Eighteen months’ provisions,” he chuckled. “The
Argenta could withstand a siege.” The boat was sailing
beautifully, ten thousand feet up; it was a glorious
day, cloudless and fine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now for the chef d’œuvre,” said Sir John. “Why,
where is Masters? This is his work.” He telephoned
through: “All going well?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Splendidly, Sir John.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What speed?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“About three hundred an hour. We’ve just sighted
Plymouth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Plymouth,” said Mavis in amazement. “Why, we
have only just left Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come along to us, Masters. I want you to demonstrate
the working of the atmospheric shutters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you come into the compressed air room?”
said Masters as soon as he arrived.</p>

<p class='c012'>They found it was quite a small room which held no
furnishings of any kind. Levers and switches and
strange electrical contrivances were everywhere, and
on one side of the room were twelve levers, very like
those in a signal box on the railways.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My idea was this,” began Masters. “We have
ten engines on board, of which we use only one at a
time; the others are reserve stock, as it were, or would
be useful if we came up against very nasty weather and
needed a stronger power to use against the elements.
At the time I worked out my theory, Sir John had no
interest in life. You two young gentlemen we believed
were dead, and I have neither kith nor kin. It struck
us, that one day we might try and reach the outside of
the earth’s atmosphere for experimental purposes. I
needn’t go into exact figures now, it would not interest
Mrs. Forsyth, but you all know after a certain distance
up life becomes impossible. Should we ever reach that
height, we should have recourse to these levers,” and
as he spoke he pulled them down one after the
other. “Now we will put the electric light on, and I
would be glad if you would step out on to the upper
deck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis gave a cry of amazement. Gone was the view
of the sky; gone the heavens above and the earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>beneath. The entire ship was covered in with an
awning of metal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do explain,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This covering works almost on the principle of a
Venetian blind,” went on Masters. “There are really
two coverings, with a space of thirty inches between.
The levers release the metal and it unfolds and clips
into position by means of strong clasps. By means of
another lever we fill the cavity between with a mixture
of gases—ether is the chief component, and this makes
our little home absolutely air proof and rain proof; and
above all it makes the inner vessel impervious to atmospheric
pressure or gravitation. We hope later on, by
the aid of an electrical device we are still working upon,
to generate an atmosphere of our own, outside the
vessel, which will enable us to propel ourselves through
infinite space, and thus we should be independent of the
atmospheric peculiarities around us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how can we breathe?” asked Mavis the
practical.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Masters thought of that contingency also,” said
Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the little room we have just left are dynamos for
generating our own electricity; there is also another
dynamo for generating an inexhaustible supply of air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have left nothing to chance,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing, my boy. Remember this is the culmination
of over thirty-five years of study and experiment,
and the last five years have seen us progress by leaps
and bounds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our absence had its good side, after all,” said
Alan. “Had we been allowed to remain, you might
never have got this machine to such perfection.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’d rather not have had those years of sorrow, all
the same,” said Sir John softly. “I’d rather have
destroyed the Argenta with my own hands, and never
built her up again, than you should both have left me
for those long years,” and the old man turned away
with a sigh. “Now about our air supply,” he went
on, recovering himself. “As the used up air sinks to
the ground, it is attracted into pipes, and by the aid of
tiny electric fans is driven to a large cylinder. There it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>undergoes a kind of filtering process. The purer
portions go into circulation again, while the carbonic
acid gas is taken down pipes which run along the whole
side of the ship to an outlet where it can escape into
space. To guard against the extrance of any unknown
noxious gases, this pipe has a trap in every foot, which
closes mechanically as the gas passes through. The
mechanism of these traps makes it impossible for any
foreign air to enter. No matter where we are, or
through what poisonous air we may pass, we are protected
from its entrance by this device; while it is impossible
for the ship to collapse while it is protected by
its envelope of ether.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you could live as long as your provisions
lasted on the Argenta?” asked Desmond. “You are
not dependent on the outer world for anything?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are dependent only on ourselves,” replied Sir
John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, it’s like a fairy tale,” said Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tea,” said a voice from behind them. “Tea, Mrs.
Forsyth.” It was Hector. Masters had unobtrusively
left while they were all talking, and Hector had turned
cook.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tea is served in the Bows,” said Hector again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters had drawn back the shutters, and once again
the little room was flooded with sunshine. The telephone
bell tinkled. “Well, Masters?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are passing over Whitby, sir. Do you wish
to cut across country direct for Dalmyrnie, or will you
go right round by the coast?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time is getting on. I think we had better make
straight for home.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s been a wonderful success,” said Alan. “More
wonderful than I could have dreamed possible.” Sir
John beamed at the praise. “But, Uncle John, leave
your atmospheric experiments until I come back from
Kalvar. I’d love to accompany you on your
adventures.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would you really?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing would give me greater pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look,” said Mavis presently. “We are over Loch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Tay. How beautiful it looks from here. Why there
is still a suspicion of snow on Ben Lawers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are very near home, now,” said Desmond,
looking at her fondly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Within a very few minutes the great vessel tilted ever
so slightly, and then with a graceful movement, slanted
her nose to earth. There was only the faintest suspicion
of a jolt as she touched the ground, and then
ran smoothly along the field, coming to a standstill at
almost the very spot she had left a few hours before.</p>

<p class='c012'>The trial was over! The machine had proved her
worth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Science had won yet another brilliant victory.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE END OF THE WORLD</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Four days had passed, four days of glorious sunshine.
Every day the whole party had been for a trip in the
Argenta. They never landed anywhere, however, for
Sir John was still jealous of his secret; he wanted to
test her in every kind of weather—he wanted to leave
nothing to chance, so that finally her worth could not
be questioned.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was nothing for them to circle over the Outer
Hebrides in the morning, come home for lunch, and
then run over as far as Paris before dinner. Scarcely
any motion was to be felt in the boat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan had made arrangements with Sir Christopher
Somerville to accompany the expedition to Kalvar.
Desmond was to stay behind and look after Mavis, who
intended staying at Dalmyrnie until her baby was born.
Her fingers were busy fashioning tiny garments for the
little newcomer, whose arrival was expected very soon.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What shall we do to-day?” asked Sir John.
“Mavis, my dear, would you like to rest? You look
very tired.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, nothing does me as much good as a sail in the
Argenta, Uncle John. Let us go up after lunch for a
couple of hours.” There was a curious stillness in the
air, as the Argenta climbed up to six thousand feet,—hardly
a breeze, in fact.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh I’m stifling,” said Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My poor darling,” murmured Desmond lovingly.
“Are you sure you are not overtiring yourself? Your
fingers never seem still. Always working at something
or other, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>She blushed prettily. “I can’t let—him—come into
the world and find we’ve not prepared for him, can
I?” and she hid her face on her husband’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve made up your mind it’s to be a—‘him’—?”
he laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, Dez. I must have a son first.” He
laughed at her naïve remark.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well if you feel tired be sure and tell me, darling,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shouldn’t be surprised if we had a storm later,”
remarked Masters. “Although the sky is clear, there
is the curious oppressiveness that usually precedes a
storm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then let us get back,” said Mavis. “I am terrified
at thunder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Majestically the Argenta sailed, gracefully she
skimmed along the sky. Now above the level of the
clouds, now close down above the waters of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How beautiful the islands look, dotted about in the
water,” said Alan. “It is indeed a pearl-studded sea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hector came up to Sir John with a puzzled frown.
“I don’t quite like the look of the weather,” said he.
“The compass won’t work, and the altimeter is frisking
about in a most unaccountable manner. There’s
a bad storm brewing, and I think we shall be wise to
turn her nose round and go back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you think it is best,” agreed Sir John, and as he
spoke the sun burst out in all its glory from behind a
fleecy cloud. At the same moment, away on the
horizon, where angry blue-black clouds had gathered,
came a vivid flash of lightning.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” cried Mavis as she covered her eyes, “what
a terrible flash.” In a few minutes the sky was black
and gloomy, the wind rose suddenly to a hurricane, and
the big craft was spinning and twisting in a most unsafe
manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll go back, sir,” said Hector. “Now go
inside, Mrs. Forsyth. Believe me, there’s no danger.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then followed a most awful experience. The lightning
never ceased, but lit up the ship from end to end,
the thunder crashed and the Argenta rocked violently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Gradually they steered her round, and to the accompaniment
of a most vivid flash of lightning and a
deafening roar of thunder, the ship started on her
homeward journey. At last they came safely to anchor
outside the hangar and Mavis, always nervous in a
storm, was now in a state of semi-unconsciousness.
Desmond lifted her tenderly out of the ship and carried
her to the cottage. Her nerve had completely gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night a son was born to Desmond, and old Dr.
Angus, who had been fetched in haste by Alan, spoke
very gravely of the chances of saving both mother and
child. The slightest shock would be fatal to her, he
announced, as he took his leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m glad you had a nurse in the house,” he added,
“a very wise precaution when so many miles separate
doctor and patient.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll come again?” said Desmond hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will be round again in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond, white faced, his hands twitching convulsively,
stood on guard outside his wife’s room. The
ordeal was terrible, and the perspiration stood in beads
upon his forehead. Once he heard a tiny cry, then
stillness. He dared not knock—there was a nurse
behind that closed door, and he knew he could trust
her. Still—.</p>

<p class='c012'>A hand touched him. “Go to bed, Desmond, and
try to get a little sleep.” It was Alan. “I’ll watch
for you, and I’ll give you my word I’ll call you if you’re
wanted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no, Alan. I’ll stay here. If she wants me, I
want to be near.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So the hours wore on, and no sound came from the
sick-room. Dr. Angus motored up, and without a
word disappeared within. An hour later he came out
and saw Desmond’s haggard face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You may go in for two minutes only,” said he.
“Both your wife and son will live.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a white-faced Mavis who greeted him. Her
face was lined with pain; her hazel eyes were sunk deep
into her head. In her arms she held a bundle, a little
bundle that was everything to the man and woman
beside it. “Dear, he’s like you,” whispered Mavis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>weakly, and then, with an almost roguish smile, “I
said it would be a boy.” Her eyes closed, and with her
husband’s hand in hers, she gave a contented sigh and
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whew!” said Sir John, a few days later. “I
wouldn’t go through last week again for a king’s
ransom.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank God she has pulled through,” said Alan
fervently. The two men were sitting at breakfast, the
first square meal they had had for a week.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Any news?” asked Sir John, as Alan was devouring
the <cite>Post</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not much, Uncle John. There was a new
Housing Bill brought up in the House last night. The
Government seems very rocky. There are hints of a
General Election. H’m. H’m—A bad earthquake
in South America, I see. Five thousand people killed.
Oh, and a landslip or something in New Zealand. How
shocking,” he went on, “ten thousand casualties there.
Why, it’s as bad as a war!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, it’s the States where the earthquake is,” said
Sir John who had unfolded the <cite>Scotsman</cite>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, South America,” contradicted Alan. “Listen—</p>

<p class='c015'>“A tremendous earthquake has been felt at Lima,
Valparaiso, and Buenos Aires. These three cities have
suffered great damage. Over five thousand people have
been killed outright, while the casualty list is considerably
greater. The shock was felt in Bermuda, New Guinea and
even as far north as Kentucky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then there has been one in the States as well,” said
his Uncle. And he read from his paper</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Meteorological office at Pimenta states that a serious
earthquake has occurred in New Jersey.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Later.</p>

<p class='c015'>“News has now come through that Tennessee and Vermont
have suffered considerable damage also. The loss of life is
comparatively small considering the damage done to
property. The tallest buildings have toppled over, shaken
from their foundations. The electrical supply is cut off, and
in many places severe fires are burning.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“It seems all over America,” said Alan lightly. “I
am glad we don’t go in for those merry little sideshows
in this country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your time is growing short,” said Sir John with a
sigh. “I shall miss you very much, my lad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall miss you too, sir. But of course I am rather
looking forward to the expedition.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The weather had been quite settled since the time
when the Argenta had encountered the terrible storm,
on the day preceding the birth of Desmond’s son.
Slightly sultry, perhaps, but an occasional cool breeze
tempered the heat.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day all the papers were full of the
epidemic of earthquakes that were occurring in different
parts of the world. Work in many places was disorganized,
and a fear was expressed that influences
were at work round Southern Europe which might
mean that the earthquakes would be felt nearer home.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was due to sail in two days, arrangements had
been made for him to leave Scotland the following
morning, when a wire came from Sir Christopher
Somerville. “Postponing departure of <i>Cavalier</i>
indefinitely. Fear unsafe to sail south. Awaiting
favourable report from Greenwich. Will advise you at
earliest of arrangements.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it gives us a little more of your society, my
boy,” said Sir John, and there was a pleased look in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan picked up the paper. “My God!” said he
suddenly, and his face blanched.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Following the news of the disastrous earthquakes
that have been scourging America and the islands of
the South American coast,” he read, “come accounts
of further appalling phenomena. In all parts of
America, after violent cyclones, the land has in many
places opened up, and swallowed men, animals and
buildings. The loss of life is abnormal—rough
estimates are given as high as 900,000 lives. Internal
rumblings and coastal waterspouts in Tasmania have
caused a panic among the population. The sea is too
rough for even the largest boat to sail upon. Natives
are rushing hither and thither with no real idea of where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to go for safety. Volcanic eruptions are taking place
in districts where for thousands of years the volcanoes
have been extinct. Scientists are at present unable to
account for this extraordinary outbreak of nature. As
we go to press, news has come through that Sydney
has disappeared entirely. San Francisco is in ruins.
The whole of Cape Colony has sunk below sea level—and
the water has poured over the whole country,
sweeping everything before it. A later edition of this
paper will be issued at noon, and at intervals during
the afternoon and evening with news as it comes to
hand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the worst scourge nature has ever given us,”
said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What I cannot understand,” said Alan, “is why it
is in so many places at once. Different latitudes seem
to have suffered and different lands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All that day a deep depression had taken hold of the
occupants of the little cottage, and they were all very
quiet. “Masters, motor over to Arroch Head,” said
Sir John, about six in the evening, “and if you can get
no further news, ring up the offices of the <i>Scotsman</i>.
Tell the Editor you are speaking for me. He will give
you the latest news, I am sure.” Masters was back
within the hour, his face blanched, his hands trembling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?” asked Sir John. “Is it as bad as all
that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s terrible,” replied Masters. “It’s coming
nearer home. Rome has gone entirely—so have
Naples and Athens. Spain and Portugal are under
water. Authentic news is hard to get, as telephonic
and cable communication in many places have failed.
Some air scouts were sent to investigate, and witnessed
the destruction of Spain. The air disturbances were so
great that it was with the greatest difficulty they
managed to reach England in safety.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do they think this visitation will reach us?” asked
Desmond, the picture of his wife and child coming
before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The <i>Scotsman</i> says that so far the Meteorological
Office reports no disturbances within eighty miles in all
directions of our coast. They hold out a hope, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>being an island, we may escape,” said Masters
brokenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no sleep for any one that night; but the
morning came and brought with it a blue sky and a
gentle wind. There was not even a hint of disaster in
the clear atmosphere. Hector got the big Napier out,
and all but Desmond motored in to Arroch Head. He
stayed behind with Mavis, to keep all breath of disaster
from her ears. The little village street was full
of white faced men, women and children, children
frightened because their parents were frightened, yet
realizing nothing of the danger ahead.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Any news?” asked Sir John, of old Weelum McGregor,
the hotel keeper.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, sir, an’ it’s no verra guid. Paris is on fire
the noo. There was an internal explosion in the neighbourhood
of Versailles yestere’en, and soon the roads
were running with molten lava. Paris caught fire, and
every one is powerless to suppress it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Three days passed. England and Scotland were
isolated—entirely cut off from the outer world. They
had just to wait and pray that their time of tribulation
would not come. The night was extraordinarily dark,
the wind moaned and rose in mighty gusts. The rain
came down in torrents. The thunder rolled in the
distance, and occasionally flashes of lightning lit up the
horizon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis was very restless. “Is anything the matter,
Dez?” she asked, as he sat by her bedside.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, dear?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You look worried. You make me feel anxious.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve been worried about you, my darling, that’s
all,” and he lied glibly to the sick woman.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then there suddenly rose on the air a terrific sound,
worse than the loudest peal of thunder, and the room
was brilliantly lighted from without as though by a
mighty fire. Mavis rose up in bed; her limbs were
shaking and she drew the sleeping babe still closer to
her breast. “What is it, what is it, Dez? No, no,
don’t leave me,” as Desmond was about to leave the
room. He put his arms about her and crooned to her
as if she had been a baby. The noise was terrible—one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>long, mighty roar. The room shook with the
vibration, and the light from without grew brighter and
brighter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John entered. “Mavis, my dear, you mustn’t
be frightened. Hector and Masters are launching the
Argenta—we are going to take you up in her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is happening?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t quite know, my dear, but Ben Lawers has
broken out in flames. Schiehallion and Ben More in
the distance are belching out heavy, dark smoke—I
think it’s volcanic action. Now, we’ve talked the whole
matter over, and we feel that the safest place is inside
the airship.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But listen to the wind—could it live in such a
storm?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the safest place,” said Sir John firmly. “We
will carry you and baby down in a hammock. Nurse
has already packed you a goodly store of clothes, and
then we’ll all sail away to a more healthy spot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure there’s no danger?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my dear! It’s a magnificent sight to see the
grand old Ben belching out smoke and flames. Lava
is pouring down his sides into the Tay, and Killin is
lighted up so that you can see the houses as if it was
day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gently Mavis was carried to the ship, and tenderly
lifted aboard. There was no time to waste. Sir John
had only told half the truth to the invalid. The lava
from Ben Lawers was already spreading towards
Dalmyrnie. The hot ashes were being carried on the
mighty wind, and the men were scorched and burnt
while they were launching the airship.</p>

<p class='c012'>Feverishly Masters hauled aboard packages, and
bundles, hasty provisions to supplement those on
board. A crash sounded behind them—the pine woods
at the rear of the cottage had caught fire! It was an
unearthly sight. Ben Lawers roared and hissed and
spluttered, the pine trees crackled—the whole countryside
was lit up with flames. In the distance the
surrounding peaks and Bens were beginning to show
signs of fire, and the whole scene was like a page of
Dante come true.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Everything aboard?” asked Sir John hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where’s Nurse? Isn’t she coming?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! I tried to persuade her, but she wanted to
get to Arroch Head to her mother. I told her to take
the runabout—she’s a fairly good hand with the car.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The flames drew nearer. Already their cruel tongues
were licking round the house. The hangar was
smouldering. Suddenly there came on their ears a
deafening explosion—the reserve petrol had caught
fire! The heat was unbearable. “It’s no good,”
panted Sir John. “Let’s leave the rest and get off.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please God we shall soon be out of here, and shall
be able to land in safety,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Scorched, blackened with smoke, Masters made one
more superhuman effort. He shipped his whole cargo
in safety! He swarmed up the ladder, the grappling
iron was drawn in, and the great ship slowly moved,
travelling upward with her human freight.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Argenta pitched and tossed, but Masters and
Hector worked steadily at the delicate levers. Now
they headed her right, now left; now she climbed above
the average ten thousand feet, now dropped low to
avoid the nasty air patches. Mavis was in her bed, her
eyes wide open in terror. Above the roaring of the
engines, came claps of thunder, deafening and awe
inspiring.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t understand,” she moaned. “What is
happening?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is impossible to say,” said Desmond. “But I
feel we are safer here than we should be on earth
to-night.” And the night of horror passed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Below, as they hovered to and fro, the whole country
was blazing. Dawn came, but an angry dawn. Dark
clouds scudded across the sky; the thunder grumbled
in the distance, and occasional flashes of lightning
illuminated the angry heavens.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Over Edinburgh,” answered Masters from the
other end of the ’phone, “we have scarcely moved for
the last four hours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“The engines seem disinclined to work. I can’t
make it out at all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The ship suddenly swerved to one side—a terrific
explosion filled the air, and they saw the Castle Rock
suddenly shiver, crumple up, and fall a shapeless ruin
on to the railway line beneath. In a few minutes,
Edinburgh, the Modern Athens, Edinburgh the Fair,
was a mass of flames! They watched the populace,
mad with fear, running aimlessly along the streets.
“This is awful,” muttered Alan. “Make south if you
can. Let us get away from this desolation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With a great amount of patience and skill, Masters
at length managed to get the engines to work. But
they came upon havoc and destruction whichever way
they went,—indeed, the whole world seemed to have
turned upside down. They circled London, but the
first metropolis of the world had been the first English
city to suffer from the terrible scourge. Blackened,
charred, lifeless, London was a city of the dead.</p>

<p class='c012'>As they swung in space over the dead London, they
tried to pick out the familiar landmarks, but in vain—The
Houses of Parliament were but a mass of bricks
and dust; gone was the Abbey of Westminster, levelled
to the ground was the mighty Tower of St. Edward,
belonging to the Catholic Cathedral—gone was the
Tower of London. There was not a sign of life in the
once great city.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aimlessly they flew in all directions. The whole of
England was a flaming mass. They headed for the
Continent. It was true, Paris had gone; Brussels was
no more; there was not a city left. Denmark was
wiped out,—and the sea washed up noisily and angrily
over a barren rock that had once been Norway. At
short intervals terrific explosions rent the air, and the
vibration caused the Argenta to perform many nerve-racking
aerial gymnastics.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Head for the Atlantic if you can,” cried Alan in
despair. For ten days they had hovered over dead
cities, dying lands, and waste voids. Navigation was
almost impossible, the hurricanes drove the craft this
way and that; now forcing her high, now bringing her
low. It was all very fearsome, very terrifying. Mavis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>was up, and with her baby in her arms she followed the
men about, a forlorn pathetic figure. Landing was
impossible—there was no place where they could land.
They had plenty of water, plenty of provisions, but they
ate mechanically, scarcely realizing what it was that
Hector placed before them with unvarying regularity.</p>

<p class='c012'>They watched Europe sinking—the vast Atlantic was
slowly but surely washing over lands and countries that
had once been great empires.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Argenta was wonderful; no matter what the
atmospheric disturbances were, she always righted
herself. The heat, at times, was terrific, and the
Argenta was forced to climb out of the reach of the
burning wastes below. Then the water of the ocean
seemed to rise like steam—the Atlantic itself was
boiling, and as it grew hotter and hotter, the ocean
seemed to grow less in size.</p>

<p class='c012'>The heat was so intense that the Argenta rose to a
great height and remained among the clouds. After
some days she descended, but seemed to be in a new
world altogether. There was a large tract of barren
land stretched out before them—gone was the Atlantic
in its vastness. Dead bodies lay strewn about—the
remains of great ships were embedded in the earth.
Animals, humanity, fish, lay mixed together in that
arid waste.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly Alan spoke, very reverently. “And the sea
shall give up its dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Atlantic?” whispered Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think so,” answered Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>And as they watched there came a mighty sound,
greater than any they had heard before. The whole
world shook, and for one moment was a living ball of
fire. Then it shivered violently, split into a thousand
pieces, and from its gaping wounds belched forth smoke
and flames. Once more came the terrible sound, the
sound of a world’s death cry; there was a mighty crash,
the flames went out and where the world had been—was
nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>All was black, all was gone; the earth had returned
to its original state; the sea had disappeared entirely;
shapeless, dark,—the earth was dead! And in her last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>convulsive hold on life, she shook the very heavens.
The Argenta was whirled round and round in a
maelstrom of agony, and then was shot into space.</p>

<p class='c012'>With a mighty effort Masters released the shutters,
and filled the intervening cavity with the ether. It was
his last conscious act. On, on went the Argenta, at a
terrific speed. The fury of the heavens seemed let
loose, and the atom in the firmament was like a wisp of
wool in its grasp. Turning, twisting, rolling, the
Argenta was borne on the bosom of the whirlwind,
and carried with its seven souls of Terra; seven souls
that had escaped from, but had witnessed The End Of
The World.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>IN SPACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Space—infinite space! On, on, swept the Argenta
through the heavens at frightful speed. The engines
were useless; the levers refused to work, and the
occupants of the airship sat within the shuttered vessel,
helpless.</p>

<p class='c012'>For days they had eaten nothing—they were unable
to move; terror had them fast within its grasp.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir John,” said Masters at last, “I’m going to
make a cup of tea. Here we are, and here we must
remain until our food gives out. Mrs. Desmond,—won’t
you come and help me?” Mavis rose from an
armchair, and tenderly laid the sleeping babe on the
cushions of a settee.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My baby,” she murmured, “to think I bore you
for this.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, Mrs. Desmond,” and Masters led the way
to the tiny kitchen.</p>

<p class='c012'>All sense of direction had gone, and the occupants
of the giant airship, had simply to accept the extraordinary
conditions that had been thrust upon them,
and remain helpless in the Argenta, carried they knew
not whither, adrift in the heavens. They had ceased
to reckon time, minutes had no meaning; hours and
days passed as one long whole. They were just
atoms, existing in space, which is infinite—where time
is infinite—where life itself is infinite!</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis entered with a tray laden with tea and
biscuits—the exertion had done her good, and already
there was a slight colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>The airship was ploughing along at a terrific rate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>but its motion was steady, and they could walk about
in comfort. When first the explosion that had
accompanied the end of the world sent them spinning
into the infinite unknown, the Argenta had behaved in
a most erratic way. Broadside she skimmed like an
arrow, throwing them from side to side, then she
reared up on her tail, and climbed the heavens almost
perpendicularly; then she would roll over and over,
porpoise-like, until the frail mortals lost all sense of
everything except that a great calamity had come into
their lives.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we?” asked Mavis suddenly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I intend to try and find out,” said Masters grimly.
“Whatever happens we can’t be in a worse position
than we are at this moment. I intend to move the
shutters from the bows and then we may get some
idea of where we are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But is it safe?” objected Desmond, looking first
at his wife and then at his child. “So far we are safe.
This mad journey must come to an end some time or
other. Why jeopardize all our lives for the sake of
a little curiosity?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Must it come to an end?” said Sir John
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” answered Desmond. “We can’t go
on forever.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not?” continued his Uncle. “Space is
infinite. Now time is eternity. We, when in the
world—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How strange that sounds,” interrupted Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I was saying, when we were in the world,
we often used the expression, ‘For ever and ever.’ If
we thought what it really meant, it dazed our brains;
we wanted to probe further, and find out what it was
that came after that ‘ever and ever.’ We puzzled
our intellects by pondering on the infinity of time. I
realize now, what Eternity is! Since we have been
here, I have ceased to count the minutes; I have
ceased to think of days, or night, or weeks. Time
is! That is enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you really think we may go on forever?”
asked Desmond in horror.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“I don’t know. I certainly think it is as likely as
not.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh God,” Desmond muttered between his clenched
teeth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, dear,” said Mavis bravely. “We ought
to be thankful that the promptitude of Uncle John
and Masters saved us from an awful death below.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure it was ‘down below’?” asked Alan
quizzically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, of course,” Mavis began. Then she
stopped. “Oh I don’t know. That is all so strange
and puzzling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, Masters,” said Sir John. “What were you
going to do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was going to release the shutters from the bow.
I can close the patent traps, and leave the ether
protection all round the ship,” he explained to the
others. “But it is possible to leave a small portion
of the glass in the bows, exposed, through which we
shall be able to see the course we are taking.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think it’s worth making the experiment,” said
Sir John, and they all followed him into the comfortable
front cabin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now if you see the slightest sign of danger,
’phone me,” said Masters, who was going into the
lever room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How can you tell if danger is near?” asked Mavis
with interest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This way,” said Masters. He pointed to a portion
of the glass wall, now covered with the outer sheet of
aluminium.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That portion of the glass is of extra thickness and
strength. If the outside air pressure is too great, or
the gravitation or any unknown element too powerful
for it, that glass will bulge, either inwards, or outwards.
Only slightly at first, but it will get bigger
and bigger until it bursts asunder. Now, if you see
the slightest suspicion of that happening, ’phone
through to me, and I will close the shutters again.
At any rate, we shall have done no harm, and at least
we shall have tried to do something to ease our
position.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>In breathless silence they waited, watchful in the
dark. Suddenly a tiny ray of light lit up the stygian
gloom. Bigger and bigger it grew, until the whole
of Masters’ wonderfully planned “lookout” was
exposed to view. Breathlessly they watched. There
was not the slightest sign of strain upon the glass.
It was certainly capable of protecting them for the
present at any rate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All serene,” cried Alan through the ’phone.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything safe?” from Masters at the other end.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite safe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh-h-h-h.” It was Mavis. “How wonderful!”
They were looking into endless space at last! They
had no sense of location—no ordinary sense of North
or South—East or West. They were in the heart of
the Solar system, with no horizon to act as a guiding
line! The vastness of space overwhelmed them; there
was no landmark to direct them. There was no
comforting horizon, with mighty arms outstretched,
embracing the world. There was nothing to give
them a feeling of security. Here space just “went
on” for ever and ever, beyond human comprehension.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wherever they looked, there was just—no end.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the scene was beautiful beyond comparison.
Away to their right, in the dark recesses of the
firmament, was a wonderful brightness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s the Milky Way,” said Mavis clapping her
hands in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think so,” said Alan. “But all the same,
I think that gives us an idea in what direction we
are flying. That brightness must be the Greater
Magellanic Clouds in the Southern Constellation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, are they only clouds, then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, just stars. Stars of all magnitudes, richly
strewn in the heavens. Even the faintest of the nebulæ
are more abundant than in any other part of the
firmament.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s wonderful,” said Sir John. “The illuminating
brightness is almost overpowering.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were unable to take their eyes from the cloud-like
condensation of stars—one of the glories of space.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We don’t seem to be getting any nearer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>it, although we are going at such a pace,” said
Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear,” answered her uncle. “We are too
many miles away to see any appreciable lessening of
distance between us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is that bright star there,” asked Mavis
pointing. “Just a little to this side of the Magellanic
Clouds?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know. It certainly is wonderfully bright,”
answered Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was searching the heavens. “Isn’t that the
Constellation of Draco—the Dragon—?” he asked
suddenly. “I think it must be. If so, that star, as
you call it, which lies between the Greater Magellanic
Cloud and Draco must be Jupiter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jupiter?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. One of Jupiter’s poles lies in the heart of
Draco, and the other is close by the Greater Magellanic
Clouds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis puckered her brows. “Jupiter,” she almost
whispered, “the Prince of all the Planets?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We don’t seem to know much about him, do
we?” she went on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said her husband. “The astronomers seem
much more interested in Saturn and Mars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve often thought,” said Alan, “that such a
magnificent orb could not have been created just to
have shown our old earth light. Its beauty, its
grandeur, its magnitude, suggests to us the noblest
forms of life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You think it is inhabited?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not? Surely its beauty and magnitude alone
are a convincing proof of the insignificance of our
earth. If Terra was inhabited, populated with many
fine races of human beings, possessed of glorious
scenery, and full of nature’s wonders, surely if such a
puny world as ours was peopled, why should a far
finer planet be debarred from possessing and nurturing
higher forms of animal life?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It sounds very interesting,” said Mavis laughing,
“but I wonder whether it’s true.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“If people are on Mars, or Saturn, or Jupiter, they
would hardly be like us,” announced Desmond,
grandiloquently. “They would either be like the
Mechanical Martians that Wells wrote of, or just
animal life of some gelatinous matter as favoured by
Wolfius.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh you egotistical, egregious Englishman,”
laughed Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can you beat him?” said Alan. “No one but
a Britisher <i>could</i> have made that remark!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a laugh at Desmond’s expense, and then
Alan went on, “Personally, I feel convinced that ours
was not the only inhabited planet. Even our feeble
knowledge of the solar system, individually and in
bulk, has proved the wonder of Jupiter, the symmetry
and perfection of the system that circles round him,
the glory of his own being, and he should rank as
the world of worlds. I should be inclined to believe
that Jupiter is not only capable of producing the
highest forms of life, but that his humanity surpasses
in intelligence the most cultured, most brilliant, most
learned of our earth’s philosophers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no, I won’t have that,” said Desmond.
“Look at the brilliant men of letters Britain alone
has given to the world. Think of her eminent
scholars, dauntless pioneers—why no other country or
world could compete with Britain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I remarked before, the egregious Englishman!”
said Sir John. “I admire your courage, my
boy, in sticking to your guns. I admire your loyalty
to the country that gave you birth. But we are not
in the world now, my boy. Our beautiful little planet
has vanished, has disappeared into the void from
which it came; yet here, before our eyes, we see
Jupiter still existing, still a brilliant orb in the sky.
Surely now, Desmond, you are convinced of the
minuteness of the planet upon which you were bred
and born?” Sir John put his hand on Desmond’s
shoulder. “While you were upon it, it was everything.
Now it is nothing—gone—while other planets
still exist and shed their brightness over space.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I think,” said Mavis thoughtfully, “that if our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>own little world possessed such a high form of life,
and we measure a planet by its bulk, then surely the
Jovians must be the most highly favoured race in the
Solar Kingdom?”</p>

<p class='c012'>A tiny cry came from the cabin behind. “Baby,”
she cried. “Oh, I’d forgotten him,” and she fled to
her nursling who had missed his mother’s care.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such are the wonders of the heavens,” said Sir
John, thoughtfully. “It’s so grand, so massive, so
unbelievable, that it makes even a mother forget, in its
contemplation, her first-born, her little son.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why he is not named yet,” said Desmond. “I
had forgotten all about that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, we have no parson here,” said Alan.
“Now our world has gone, can we call ourselves
Christians? How do we rank with the Almighty?
Have we become atoms tossed about on an endless
sea, or Christians to whom eventual release will
come?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are still in God’s Hands,” said Sir John
reverently. “In the absence of an ordained priest,
a layman may administer the Sacrament of Baptism.
I am getting very old. I have one foot very near the
grave. Shall I do it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please,” said Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>And whirling through the Solar system, belonging
neither to earth nor heaven, was performed surely the
strangest rite ever known from time immemorial.
And it was in this strange place, in this strange manner
that Desmond and Mavis’ son—John Alan—was
named.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>ADRIFT IN THE SOLAR REGIONS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Life in the Argenta became very monotonous. After
the first throes of despair, the glimpse of the glorious
expanse of the Heavens served to cheer the prisoners
within the ship. They had no clocks that were going.
During the terror of the first few days time had
mattered so little to them that they had let them run
down. They now arranged to set all the clocks, and
judge the time accordingly, and plan out their days.
Rise at eight; lunch at one; tea at four; and dinner at
seven and then to bed. The “night” would pass
and they would begin another “day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They reckoned they had sufficient food to last the
twelve earth months, and they could exist in comfort
for three hundred and sixty-five days. And with the
minutest care, perhaps even longer. “We can’t live
in space for more than twelve months, surely,” said
Mavis, but Sir John did not answer her. They had
consumed perhaps an eighth of their water supply,
and had the supply of concentrated water essence
untouched. Still, they were afraid to waste any for
washing purposes, and considered it a treat to be
allowed to dip their fingers in any fluid that was left
over from cooking; even a drop of cold tea proved a
boon to them, and they gratefully damped cloths in
it and wiped their hot and dry faces.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan fixed a piece of paper on the wall of the front
cabin, and every night before they retired, he would
tick off the number of the day from the time they
had reset their clocks and begin to count again.
Thirty, forty, fifty, so the “days” passed, and little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>John Alan grew enormously. The few garments that
had been packed in their hurried flight were now too
small for him, and Mavis was forced to use some
of her own dresses, and cut them up for the
growing child. He alone was unconscious of the
danger of their peculiar position, and he crowed and
gurgled and bit his toes, in complete babyish happiness
and delight. If anything, Mavis had grown more
beautiful after the arrival of her child. Her eyes
glowed with maternal pride, and her cheeks were
flushed with joy as she watched her baby, born into
such a strange life, grow day by day fairer and more
loving.</p>

<p class='c012'>The library aboard, which Sir John had had the
foresight to install in his giant Argenta, proved a
godsend to the weary travellers. Every day they read
aloud some old literary favourite, and renewed their
acquaintance with Sam Weller, Pip, the Aged P, and
Little Nell; laughed over the experiences of the
“Innocents Abroad” enjoyed again the story of
“Three Men in a Boat.” But even with these
diversions, with chess, dominoes, and draughts; with
singing and playing, they grew tired of their enforced
inactivity, and chafed at their surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their air supply was excellent; the mechanism never
failed in its work; certainly the air grew hot and fetid
at times but by the aid of electric fans it was freshened
and purified. Every day they looked out of the little
glass window, and drank in the glories of the heavens.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day, it was the ninety-eighth according to
Alan’s chart, Mavis startled them all by a sudden
exclamation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it, my dear?” asked Sir John, looking
up from an interesting game of chess he was enjoying
with Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look at Jupiter! Isn’t he large to-night?” said
she. “Why, yesterday he looked like a big star,
to-day he is like the moon at harvest time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They all crowded round the little window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, you’re right,” said Alan. “We must be
sailing in a direct line toward him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How plain the clouds are upon him,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Desmond. “You can see them plainly right across
his face.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The belts across the face of Jupiter were certainly
very plain; across the surface of the planet they
floated pearly white, like masses of “snow-clouds” as
seen in England on a hot summer’s day. From the
equatorial region they merged, both north and south
from a glorious coppery colour, becoming a deep,
ruddy purplish tint at the poles.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are they clouds like ours?” asked Mavis wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t think it has ever been proved what they
really are,” answered Alan. “I think the general
theory is, that those clouds as you call them are, in
reality, a vapour-laden atmosphere that floats across
the orb.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should love to go there,” said Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it looks as though we were making for that
part of the firmament,” said her uncle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It certainly does,” she retorted. “But when
shall we reach there?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At that moment Masters and Hector came in, in
great excitement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The engines are working,” announced Hector
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What!” from all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s true. Masters and I were tinkering at them
this morning, when suddenly the little starting cog
flew round, there was a roar, a flash of sparks, and
they started properly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This was indeed good news, for ever since the end
of the world the airship had been propelled through
space by some unknown outside influence; her engines
not only refused to work but her steering apparatus
refused to act.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I intend navigating straight ahead,” announced
Masters. “I’ll have eight engines going, and then we
ought to get up a speed of over four hundred and
fifty miles; that together with the pace we are already
travelling should help us considerably in reaching
somewhere, if there is anywhere for us to get.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Eagerly they all went into the engine room, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>watched first one, then another of the powerful
engines set going. They were however surprised to
find that they felt no difference in their speed; yet the
speedometer registered four hundred and twenty miles,
and all eight engines were working merrily.</p>

<p class='c012'>They went back to the bows, and watched the
universe stretched out before them. They passed close
to a star, whose name they did not know, and its
radiance lit up the little cabin for fourteen days, that
were marked off religiously on Alan’s calendar. Then
came another terrible time, when depression took hold
of them all again, and they would sit, silent, staring
into space. Their eyes were dull and lustreless; their
limbs cramped from lack of exercise, and their brains
torpid and sluggish.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps Alan felt the deprivation of air and exercise
most, but he continued to be the cheeriest of them all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, for some green vegetables,” sighed Mavis
one day. John Alan had been particularly restless,
and she felt more than usually miserable.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And plenty of nice rabbit food,” went on Alan
cheerfully. “Crisp, long lettuces, the rosy radish,
juicy tomatoes, and above all the cool, refreshing
slices of the unwholesome cucumber.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Alan, I’m so miserable,” she sobbed. “Will
this awful existence never end? Shall we just die
here, and this ship become the meteoric tomb of seven
unfortunates of the world? A tomb always spinning
on, on, through endless space, through endless time,
like some lost soul.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lost world, you mean,” corrected Alan. “You
are mixing your metaphors, and when a lady does that,
it’s a sure sign she wants a cup of tea!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t want a cup of tea, Alan. I just want to
get a breath of air. Alan, couldn’t you persuade
Masters to open the shutters? Couldn’t we just go
on to the deck for five minutes—only five minutes?”
she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear,” said Alan gently. “It’s quite
impossible. Now listen carefully to what I am
saying. Long, long ago, we were out of the atmosphere
and the gravitation of our earth. In some way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>or other, the tornado that accompanied the end of
our world drove us through space where nothing is!
Oh, I know it sounds complicated, dear, but by all the
knowledge of science, as taught by the most advanced
astronomers, long ago we should have been suspended
in space, unable to move or be moved, outside the
gravitation of other worlds; just atoms, motionless,
still. That hasn’t happened. We have defied the
great authorities, and are being whirled through the
heavens by some power unheard of by the scientists
of the earth. Still, dear, we do not know whether
there is air outside. Should we lift the shutters that
protect us, we might find we were unable to exist.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s the word,” cried Mavis. “We aren’t
living now. We are only existing. We don’t know
from hour to hour what terrible fate may await us.
If by lifting the shutters we kill ourselves, surely that
is better than this lingering death.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mavis, Mavis, don’t.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know we have only a month’s supply
of food left?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked at her in horror. “You don’t mean
that, Mavis?” said he incredulously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear Alan, you are just like all men. Sufficient
for the day! That’s your motto. You never
enquired about the food. Since I took over the
culinary department, none of you have worried a bit,
while day by day I’ve seen our stock of provisions
grow less and less. In a month’s time, Alan, our food
will be totally exhausted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What about the condensed foods?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh we still have some of them—perhaps with
extreme care they would last another four weeks, and
then—the end.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why didn’t you tell me before, Mavis?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh I couldn’t,” hysterically. “You were all so
contented. Besides I didn’t realize the seriousness of
it myself until to-day. Our flour is nearly gone.
You yourself said the bread wasn’t as good this
morning. Of course it wasn’t. It was just mixtures
of every cereal I could think of to try and make it
last out.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>This news was indeed serious, and Alan walked
thoughtfully to his chart. Yes, he ought to have
known. It registered five hundred and fifty-five days.
Over eighteen earth months they had been flying
through the heavens. Their food had lasted
magnificently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Water?” he queried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We finished the tank water long ago. I’m pretty
well through with the cubes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me come and see the food supply.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Carefully he went over every item. Even yet, there
seemed to be enough to feed an army, but he knew how
little there was in reality. “I think if we have one
good meal a day, we ought to make it last longer,”
said he. “After all, one good meal is better than
three small ones, and incidentally, we save over the
one transaction. We must sleep longer, that’s all.
We will get up at noon, and have a cup of tea and a
biscuit. At four we will have dinner, and if we retire
at eight, a cup of cocoa then should suffice us. The
longer we remain in bed the less food we shall require.
Come, let us tell the others.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John took the news very quietly. Not a
muscle of his face twitched—he might have been
receiving a most ordinary announcement. Masters
shrugged his shoulders indifferently, and Murdoch
went on with his work as if he had not heard.
Desmond took the news badly, however. His face
grew ashen. “Why should this have come upon
us?” he cried. “We had been through so much.
Happiness came my way at last, and now—” He
drew Mavis fiercely to him. “I won’t lose you.
There must be some way out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is none, my boy,” said Sir John, “so you
had better make up your mind to that at once. Here
we are and here we must remain, till by some merciful
intervention, we die, or are given release.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where shall we ever find release?” from
Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In some new world, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How big Jupiter is,” said Alan, looking out into
the vastness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“He is certainly a wonderful planet,” said
Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it my fancy or are we slowing down?” asked
Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve wondered the same thing myself,” said
Masters. “For the last few days I have noticed an
appreciable difference in our speed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But although the difference was so slight as to be
almost undiscernible, the new topic of conversation
gave the prisoners new life.</p>

<p class='c012'>The days passed—the quantity of the food they
consumed grew daily less and less, and they were
growing weaker and weaker every day. At length
they gave up their cup of tea in the mornings—their
tea had gone. Then they halved their dinner portions
making one day’s share of food last two! But all the
same the dreaded day came only too soon, and five
hundred and ninety-five days after Alan had put up his
calendar, they found they had only a few tins of concentrated
food left. They were all hungry. Little
John Alan grew fretful, his mother feverish. There
was silence in the little front cabin, the silence of the
grave. The little party were all half asleep, when
suddenly Alan rose. “What’s the matter?” he
asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” asked his uncle.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you realize?—we’ve stopped! We’ve
stopped!” It was true, the Argenta was stationary
at last! At the same moment Masters came rushing
in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ve stopped!” he cried. “The engines have
refused again to work.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They all crowded round the little “lookout,” but
could see nothing. For the first time for nearly two
years their vision was limited. Gone was the brightness
of Jupiter, gone the glorious Magellanic Cloud—gone,
too, the many thousand points of light that
enriched the heavens. All about them was a moving
vapour. It was unlike clouds, but surged and swirled
like heavy snow flakes. It was a whitish vapour that
looked like steam—that altered again and took on the
hue of thick yellowish smoke.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Where are we?” asked Mavis. “Can’t we get
out?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll see,” said Alan soothingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>But still Mavis went on pleadingly. “Oh surely our
chance has come at last. If we opened the shutters
now, we might get free altogether.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The next morning, Murdoch was missing. His bed
had not been slept in. “Where’s Murdoch?” asked
Alan of Masters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know. I’ve been expecting him to relieve
me in the engine room every minute. Is he in the
kitchen?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. I can’t find him anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good God! Then I know what he has done,”
said Masters brokenly. “He was very upset over Mrs.
Desmond yesterday. She wanted me to open the
shutters. Come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the stern of the ship and on the lower deck was a
little trap door in the metal covering. “He’s gone
through there,” said Masters hoarsely. “He asked me
a lot of questions about it last night. I told him
about the mechanism of this trap and he suggested we
should go out on deck, and see if it was possible to
breathe out there. I laughed at him and thought no
more about the matter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As he was speaking he deftly wound a scarf about his
nose and mouth, and stuffed his ears with cotton wool
saturated with oil. He touched a spring and a sheet of
metal unfolded and when it rested at last in position, it
formed a tiny air tight closet outside the trap. “I
shall open the trap as quickly as I can,” said he quickly.
“On the other side the deck is opened up and there is
a space left large enough to test thoroughly the outer
air. But by the aid of this “cubby-hole” we still have
our ether protection kept safe all round the ship. Now
I am going out to see if Murdoch is there. If I don’t
come back, don’t search for me. It will be too late.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Masters, don’t go!” urged Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must go,” grimly, “but I beg of you, if I don’t
return in ten minutes, forget I ever existed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without another word he slipped into the little boxlike
chamber, and the door snapped to after him. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>heard the sound of a click, rushing air, and then,
silence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Five minutes passed—six—seven—eight. Sir John,
Desmond and Mavis had come up in time to hear the
trap close, and quickly Alan explained the position.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did you let him go?” cried Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Murdoch went for you, my dear,” he answered
sternly. “Masters went to save him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis covered her face with her hands, and the tears
trickled down her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear, don’t take it to heart,” went on Alan
kindly. “If anything happens to Murdoch, he will
have given his life for his friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then a muffled cry came from within the little
chamber. Quickly Alan touched the lever, the folds of
metal rolled back, and two figures fell forward on their
faces.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Water,” commanded Alan, and Mavis rushed to
get some.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you any brandy left?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A very little.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bring some too,” he cried as Mavis disappeared
into the kitchen. Tenderly they wiped blood and sweat
from the faces of the unconscious men.</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters opened his eyes. “Out there,” said he
hoarsely. “Terrible smell—sulphuric—can’t breathe
properly—whirling clouds—eyes smart—don’t go
again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’ll do,” said Sir John. “How’s Murdoch?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s so terribly cold,” said Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan took his place by the still form. “Brandy,”
said he. He looked at the man on the floor. Thick
veins like whipcords stood out upon his forehead.
Blood trickled from his nose, his ears, his mouth. His
lips were swollen, and were blue in colour and
cracked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s gone,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dead?” cried Mavis in horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite dead.” Gently they carried the dead man,
who had risked his life for his friends, to his little
sleeping cabin. Tenderly they laid him on his bed,
covered up his face, and closed the door softly behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>them. Then they went back to Mavis who was watching
over Masters.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How is he?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Better, I think. He asked for water. I think he
is sleeping now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan bent over their old and valued friend. The
look of pallor had vanished, the veins subsided, he was
breathing naturally.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor Murdoch,” sobbed Mavis. “I feel it was my
fault. I was always worrying you to open the shutters
and let us go outside.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t worry, little one,” said Sir John. “He died
like an English gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh how terrible everything is,” she sobbed
hysterically. “There seems no end to our torment.
Oh this horrible place, this horrible ship of doom!”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>THE VISION OF A NEW WORLD</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Perfect silence, perfect stillness, and the clouds whirled
round and round outside.</p>

<p class='c012'>In vain they tried to move the ship. The engines
worked smoothly, and with perfect rhythm, but were
powerless to propel the Argenta.</p>

<p class='c012'>The death of Murdoch had a terribly depressing effect
on every one—they all missed his kindly brusqueness,
his forethought and stolid help.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Masters was sufficiently recovered he told his
story. “I got through the ether all right,” said he.
“I was through in a second and was standing on the
exposed deck at the mercy of the elements. The cold
was intense—I’ve never before experienced anything
like it. In those few seconds it just cut through me.
I could hardly see—my eyes filled with water, and
smarted terribly as the gaseous vapour touched them. I
lowered my handkerchief for the tiniest fragment of a
second, and drew a very slight breath. The effect was
terrible. My lungs felt as if they would burst—my
mouth felt as if it had been seared with hot irons—my
senses reeled; I felt as if I should fall. Then I became
conscious of Murdoch lying huddled at my feet. I
pulled him into the cabin after me, and well,—you know
the rest. Poor Murdoch—I was too late.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The excitement following the loss of Murdoch and
Masters’ adventure after him, had made the hungry
prisoners forget the emptiness of their larder. They
all sat down to a hearty meal, and it was only at the
end they realized it meant their being on still shorter
rations in the future. And only too soon the larders
were indeed empty! Mavis grew too weak to move,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and lay helpless on her bed, her baby at her breast.
Masters was the last to give in, and as he walked
unsteadily to his cabin, he had visions of Sir John on
one chair and Alan on another, each vainly trying to
whisper words of comfort to the other.</p>

<p class='c012'>Still the ship remained motionless—the stillness was
of the grave.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly a whitish beam of light shot out through
the clouds, and Alan saw a new moon rising. And as
he watched he saw another skim the heavens, and
another, and yet another. He looked at them in perplexity—four
pink tipped crescents in the sky!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Four Moons! God!” he cried. “The four
satellites of Jupiter! Or should there be eight? Four—eight—eight—four.”
His brain muddled. Four
Moons visible at once! Jupiter! He was witnessing
the rise of four of the planet’s moons! He was watching
them through the misty clouds—then came a blessed
sense of oblivion, and he too, lost consciousness.
When he awoke again, it was with a feeling that the
Argenta was again moving through space—moving
slowly, but with a speed that was gradually quickening.
He staggered to his feet, and bent over his uncle. Sir
John was still breathing, but there was a curious greyness
in his face, and Alan moistened his lips with a
drop of brandy. The old man moved, and opened his
eyes. “Drink a little,” said Alan kindly. “It will do
you good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir. John managed to swallow a little of the burning
fluid, and sighing naturally, closed his eyes in sleep.
With difficulty, Alan managed to reach Desmond’s
room, for he was very weak. He found Mavis lying
on her bed, hardly breathing: the babe lay in her arms
sleeping peacefully. She had given the very essence of
her strength to her child, and he had scarcely suffered
at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond was breathing heavily, jerkily, the breath
came like sobs from between his clenched teeth. Alan
forced some of the brandy between his lips and said
huskily, “Dez, old boy: don’t leave me, old chap;
we’ve been through some tight corners, don’t give up
yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Desmond struggled to a sitting position. “Good
old Lanny,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must see Masters,” said Alan. “Keep up, if you
can, till I return.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan reeled from side to side in his weakness as he
struggled on to Masters’ cabin. It was empty! He
was almost too weak to think or act coherently.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Masters,” he moaned. “Where are you?” Slowly
he made his way back to the little room in the bows,
and as he neared it, a brilliant beam of light shot across
his path. The unexpectedness of it threw him off his
balance, and he would have fallen, had not Masters
rushed forward and put his arm about him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The light was strong. So strong that they could
feet the heat of its rays through the little glass
window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters could hardly speak. His lips were swollen
and blackened, and his tongue parched. “Help,” said
he thickly. “That light is like a magnet—it is drawing
us somewhere. It’s sent out by human agency I am
sure. See how it flutters and fades, only to come
bright again.” They watched the ray—it was focussed
directly on the bows, and it seemed to be drawing them
closer and closer to some harbour of refuge. Still they
were going through the encircling clouds, which had
suddenly turned to a most beautiful roseate hue. Then
without any warning they emerged and found they were
gazing on the most wonderful scene they had ever
beheld.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was more wonderful than their thoughts could have
expressed. Imagine hovering over the most wondrous
piece of natural scenery—double—treble its beauty, and
even then you could have no idea of the grandeur, the
poetry of the picture they gazed upon.</p>

<p class='c012'>They were, perhaps, three thousand feet up.
Mountains rose all round with rocky crevasses, and
wonderful waterfalls dashing down their sides. Foaming
waters trickled and bubbled and laughed by the
sides of grassy paths. An inland lake glowed in the
glory of the sunshine. Trees of all kinds nestled in the
valleys and climbed the hillsides.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>A sea—a glorious azure sea—with dancing waves and
white flecked foam rolled merrily in and out on wonderful
white sands. There were rocks and caves, and
velvety grass slopes along the sea shore; babbling
brooks merged into the blue, blue waters; tall lilies,
virginal white, mingled with roses, red like wine, and
grew in clusters at the water’s edge. All was nature at
her best—unspoiled by man.</p>

<p class='c012'>Wooded islets were dotted about in still more wonderful
bays; birds white as snow, birds with plumage
rainbow-hued floated idly on the waters, and added to
the picturesque beauty. They could see little buildings
nestling among the trees here and there, buildings that,
like the châlets of Switzerland, only added to the beauty
of the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>The airship had stopped suddenly, and they were
unable to move her, and still they hovered over the
wonderful land. Sea—sky—both of a most glorious
blue; the verdure of this new land was green—“The
same as our world,” murmured Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But with what a difference,” whispered Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never knew what the sea was until now,” said
Alan. “I never realized what ‘colour’ was—what blue
or green meant, until I looked down yonder.”</p>

<p class='c012'>New life was born in the three men. “I’ll call
Desmond,” said Alan. Mavis was lying as he had left
her—white, inert, silent. “Leave her,” he told his
cousin. “She will be quite safe; but we’ve news at
last—we are in sight of land.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When he reached the bows again, he saw they had
dropped a few hundred feet, and were now well below
the summit of the mountains.</p>

<p class='c012'>Below them, in a fertile valley, they saw what they
thought were six giant birds running along a field.
They rose, soared straight up, and flew directly toward
the Argenta. They were like swans with outstretched
wings, and necks like swans; but never had they seen
birds of such a monstrous size.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are as big as a small plane,” said Sir John
wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, I believe that’s what they are,” said
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>As the “birds” drew nearer, they could see that the
body was in reality the car of the plane. Soon six were
circling round the Argenta, and the prisoners within
could see figures standing in the cars of the strange
looking aeroplanes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Argenta gave a jolt, and quivered from stem to
stern, and they felt themselves sinking. The newcomers
had thrown out some kind of grappling rope and were
pulling them to earth. They were nearer to this
wonderful country. Already they could see the brilliant
flowers—trees laden with wonderful fruit and bright
plumaged birds fluttering about without any sign of
fear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Release the shutters,” said Alan hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Sir John with decision. “Remember we
have on board a defenceless woman and her child. We
don’t yet know if we are in the hands of friends or
enemies. I’ll get my revolver. Dez, my boy, I’ll give
it to you. Stay in your cabin and be prepared. You
understand?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shoot—her?” asked Desmond hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John bowed his head. “Surely you would rather
do it than me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no ‘but,’ my boy. Rather death than
horrors unnameable. Stay in the cabin with your wife
and child. If I think we are in good hands I will call
you. Otherwise, I will give our whistle—the one we
used when you were boys—the three sharp calls, and a
long minor note,” and he illustrated it softly. “If you
hear that,—don’t hesitate, my boy.” They gripped
hands, and Desmond, dazed, speechless, walked
unsteadily out of the room, and they heard the click of
his cabin door as it closed behind him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly, but surely the Argenta was being dragged
down to the field below. At last they touched solid
ground—there was a scrunch and a grating—they
were on some earth at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alan,” said Sir John grimly. “I have two other
revolvers on board. Masters, if the worst comes to
the worst, and I give the warning whistle for Mr.
Desmond, go in to him. If he does not turn the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>weapon on himself do it for him—and keep a spare
bullet for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understand, sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The six white “birds” had also reached land, and
from out of the bodies they saw strange figures appear.
The figures were like themselves—yet how different!
The men approaching were perhaps under average
height, but they were beautifully moulded, muscular
with a symmetry of form that was glorious to behold.</p>

<p class='c012'>All but one wore white—a garment that reached to
their feet, and which resembled in shape a Roman toga.
This white garment was embroidered with richly
coloured silks at the neck, wrists and hem. On their
heads, they wore fillets of gold. The leader was garbed
in a garment of the same shape, but of a glorious blue
bound with gold, and his fillet was studded with gems
that shone and flashed in the sunlight. All walked up
to the Argenta and smiled through the little window at
the occupants. Then the leader opened his hands—held
them up empty, and with a charming smile, bowed
low before them. Then he seemed to issue a command,
and all the others, there were altogether perhaps thirty
of them, followed his example, and bowed before them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They look friendly,” said Sir John. “Masters, let
the shutters be raised—then stand near Mr. Desmond’s
cabin. If I shout—‘view halloo!’ bid him to come
out on to the upper deck, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if I hear the whistle, sir, I shall know what to
do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Keep your revolver hidden, Alan,” said Sir John,
and they made their way to the upper deck.</p>

<p class='c012'>They waited in silence for the ether to be pumped
back into its cylinders, and for the shutters to lift.
Gradually light came creeping in through chinks here
and there—higher and higher was lifted the moving
metal, until at last the two men drank in fresh air and
bathed in glorious sunshine once again. They found
they could scarcely move along the deck—in fact it was
with the greatest difficulty they could keep their
balance. They felt horribly material and gross.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” whispered Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The law of gravity, my boy. Wherever we are, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>should say it is about three times the strength of that
we were used to when we were on Terra. I think we
have about trebled our weight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The strangers had advanced—the leader was smiling
graciously. He gave another command, and his band
of followers came to a sudden halt, and he approached
the Argenta—alone. He addressed them in a language
they did not understand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not understand—” commenced Sir John, but
before he could say any more the stranger spoke—haltingly
it is true, and as if unused to it, but he spoke
in English.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we?” cried Sir John in amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are on, what I think you would call—Jupiter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jupiter?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. And may I welcome you strangers to our
land of plenty. I know not who you are or whence you
come—but you are welcome—very welcome. But you
look tired—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are not enemies, then?” cried Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Enemies?” repeated the Jovian. “I understand
not the word.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are friends?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friends of course—we are all friends. Can you
find a more beautiful word than friendship?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank God! Thank God!” cried Sir John, and
with a wild “View Halloo” issuing from his lips, he
fell senseless to the ground.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>JUPITER AND THE JOVIANS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The sweet toned bell in the Observatory at Minnaviar
rang violently, and startled the students out of their
usual calm and placidity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan looked up from his studies. “What is
it, my Waiko?” said he in his own language to his
friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not, my Kulmervan. Let us go to the
Turret Room, and see.” The two astronomical
students at the most important meteorological college
on the whole of Keemar, went swiftly up the wide,
marble stairway to their Djoh’s room. Before they
were half way up, the bell rang louder than before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Haste, my Waiko,” said Kulmervan. “The Djoh
is anxious.” As they reached the archway leading into
the experimenting room, the Djoh met them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At last,” said he testily. “At last you are come.
I summoned you as there is a most remarkable
phenomenon registered by the sensitive disc. After we
recorded the destruction of the planet ‘Quilphis,’ you
will remember, we discovered a new comet or meteor
that seemed to have separated from the planet itself.
We witnessed this extraordinary ‘star’ whirling toward
us, daily nearer and nearer. Our learned Ab-Djohs
consulted together as to the meaning of this extraordinary
thing. At last I was consulted, and by the
aid of every scientific means we possessed we tried to
discover the substance of this new moving orb. You
recollect?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my Djoh,” answered Kulmervan, the senior
student.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“Look,” said the Djoh triumphantly, and he led the
way to a large disc that stood in front of the large
window. This disc was of glass, and was connected by
etheric pipes to a large telescopic tube fixed outside the
window. It was by the aid of this that the Keemarnians
studied the solar system, and learnt about the other
worlds in the sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>As Kulmervan looked into the disc, he saw, by
reflection, a peculiar body suspended in the heavens—stationary
it rested near Wirmir and Kosli, the twin
stars of Gorlan. “What is it?” he asked eagerly,
while Waiko, the younger student, stood silent, listening
eagerly to the conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the meteor of Marfaroo,” said he. “It is the
strange body that detached itself from Quilphis, when
the life of that unfortunate planet was run.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it is still now, my Djoh.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The four Meevors have not yet risen, my son. In
fourteen permos from now, they will be bright and
shining. When they are at their full, they will draw
that orb within our surrounding vapours. Then we
must direct our light rays upon it, and draw it within
our atmosphere. It is a wonderful thing, my son, and
will aid us in our knowledge of science. My theory is,
that it is a minute portion of the planet Quilphis itself.
Oh, very small, hardly as big as the Rorka’s palace; but
the knowledge of its composition will help us in our
research. Take turn and watch with me, my sons, and
at the right moment we will direct our Ray upon it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Eagerly the students watched. The honour was
great the Djoh had put upon them, and they were eager
to be present when the light of the four full Meevors
should shine upon the strange presence in the sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the time the Kymo sinks to rest, my sons, the
fourth Meevor will be at the full, and we will watch the
developments with interest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The three surrounded the little disc; the pale beams
from the Meevors shone distinctly on the glass; there
was a movement—the foreign body moved slowly
toward them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Ray,” cried the Djoh. “Summon the Ab-Djohs.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Ten Ab-Djohs appeared at Waiko’s call. They were
all dressed in the green tunic and vest and short cloak—the
symbol of their calling as the highest astronomers
in the land, bar one, the Djoh himself, who wore a
voluminous cloak and tall, conical hat in addition. The
wise men adjusted the focussing apparatus and directed
the nozzle toward Wirmir and Kosli. A whirring noise
sounded—and then suddenly shot out a most glorious
ray. “When Kymo has risen but four thoughts, the
orb will be here,” announced the Djoh. “Waika, go
call Waz-Y-Kjesta. Tell him the Djoh has words of
import to utter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon Waz-Y-Kjesta appeared. He was a handsome
man, fair-haired, long-limbed. He wore his blue toga
as became him as Waz of the air birds, the vessels which
were used by the inhabitants of Keemar to journey by
the sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fetch in that strange star, O Waz,” said the Djoh.
“Bring it to earth, and I will await its arrival here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta bowed low. “Your will shall be
done, my Djoh,” said he, and he went swiftly to the
place where his air birds were housed. “Mashonia,”
said he to his Waz-Mar, or Lieutenant. “Order out
six air birds, we go on a mission for the Djoh.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In a very short space of time, six beautiful “birds”
rose from the ground and skimmed toward their goal
which was now approaching very rapidly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Waz,” cried Mashonia suddenly. “It is part
of no planet that we are approaching. See, there is
glass in front, and men like ourselves are looking
toward us!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are like us, yet unlike us,” said Waz-Y-Kjesta.
“They are habited in sombre clothing—they
look dark and gloomy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where can they come from?” asked Mashonia
wonderingly. “All sons of Keemar would signal us.
They are strangers from another world, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gradually they circled round the Argenta, and
brought her safely to the ground. They watched the
lifting of the shutters curiously. This was indeed the
strangest “air bird” they had ever seen. When Sir
John gave his wild cry, the Keemarnians realized that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the strangers who had come in so wonderful a manner
to their land, had suffered acutely. “Send for six
Bhors,” said Waz-Y-Kjesta quickly, “these friends are
ill.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In the shortest space of time, the Bhors, the
Keemarnian carriages, appeared. They were comfortable
litters like vehicles, laden with rugs of silk and
downy cushions. Above were canopies of silk which
shaded the occupants, who swung hammock wise from
a wheeled frame, into the shafts of which were
harnessed magnificent colis—beasts very similar to
Shetland ponies, only with long curly hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>At a command from Waz-Y-Kjesta, Mashonia and
another leapt nimbly over the bulwarks of the Argenta,
and without a word, in turn carried all the erstwhile
prisoners of the airship, and placed them on cushions
in the comfortable Keemarnian equipages. As Alan
was carried past the Waz, he murmured feebly. “A
guard for the Argenta, please.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A look of surprise passed over the Keemarnian’s face.
“What meanest thou?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A guard,” urged Alan. “The Argenta contains
all our possessions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A guard?” answered Kjesta. “Nay, why should
we do that? It is safe there. It does not belong to us.
Fear not, no one will touch it, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gently the colis stepped out, drawing easily the Bhors
and their occupants. “Drive to the palace of the
Jkak,” said Waz-Y-Kjesta. “We must acquaint
him first with the news of the arrival of these
strangers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The weary travellers saw nothing of the country
through which they passed. They were too weary and
worn to raise themselves on the cushions and look
around. The cool breeze swept across their faces and
refreshed them, so they were content to remain as they
were and not think or worry about the future.</p>

<p class='c012'>A runner was sent before to acquaint the Jkak of
their near approach, and as they stopped at his beautiful
palace, men came out, unhooked the hammock part
of the Bhors, and carried the occupants into the Jkak’s
presence. He was awaiting them in the cool reception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>hall, and regal and patriarchal he looked, in his robe of
loose green silk, with his golden fillet low upon his
brow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My brothers,” said he in a low musical voice.
“Welcome to Keemar, the land of all good. Eat first
from yonder viands. They will revive you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Trays daintily laden with food and wine were placed
before the hungry travellers. The Jkakalata, consort
to the Jkak, attended to Mavis. “A child,” said she,
“and a woman, too. Come, Persoph,” to her
husband, “give me that glass of friankate—it will revive
her.” She moistened Mavis’s lips with the fragrant
wine—Mavis opened her eyes, and as she looked at the
kindly woman’s face, she burst into tears. “Who are
you?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am Mirasu, the Jkakalata,” she replied. “Drink
this, it will do you good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis drank long of the sweet liquor, and ate the
strange fruits that were placed before her. Alan, as
usual, was the first to recover and made a movement as
if to rise from the Bhor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay,” said Persoph. “Do not move, I beg you.
Rest, and later you can tell us your story.” Then he
turned to Desmond. “She with the babe—she is
yours?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did you know?” asked the perplexed
husband.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the look in your eye when my Mirasu handled
your babe,” said the wise old man sagely. “It was the
look of possession.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, she is my wife,” said Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wife—ah! that is the word. Now rest among the
cushions of the Bhors. Rooms are prepared for you.
Sleep, my friends, until the Kymo rises twice again.
Then refreshed and strong we will welcome you among
us, and listen with interest to your story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jkak’s palace was of a glorious green marble,
highly polished. In the entrance hall was a huge
fountain. Six beautiful maidens, their garments
chiselled out of coloured marble, held large shells from
which poured water into the basin beneath. The figures
were life size, and gracefully moulded. Lovely water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>flowers grew all around, and coloured fish swam in and
out among the pebbles and plants.</p>

<p class='c012'>Up a wide stairway, which branched out into large
galleries, the strangers were carried, the Jkak himself
leading the way, as if he were doing homage to the
Rorka himself. They wended their way through a
narrower passage which widened out again into a
spacious loggia. In the very centre of this space four
malachite pillars, highly polished, supported a crystal
shell out of which poured sparkling waters into a pond
beneath. There were six doors round the loggia; at
the first the Jkak stopped, opening it himself, led
the way in. With gentle hands Desmond and Mavis
were transferred to soft, downy beds. “Rest, my
friends, and sleep until Morkaba brings you wine and
food.” Then the other three were taken to separate
sleeping apartments, where their weary limbs rested in
contentment on the soft, downy cushions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond and Mavis’s room was perhaps the largest—a
glorious room with a wide balcony upon which
were growing the most beautiful creepers and plants—with
wonderful perfumes and flowers. An enormous
four poster bed stood in the centre of the room, with
its back immediately in front of the door. A canopy of
silk was overhead; there were no sheets or blankets
upon it, but there was an abundance of cushions, and
silken rugs of all hues. Easy chairs, plenty of mirrors
and a dressing table furnished the room. The walls
were of a polished pale pink marble, and the fittings,
tapestries and silken hangings were all of colours that
blended and made one harmonious whole. All the other
rooms were similar, except in the colouring, and on the
polished marble floors were spread rugs of exotic
colours.</p>

<p class='c012'>A silver bell tinkled! To Mavis, it sounded like the
Angelus on a summer morning. She opened her eyes;
again the bell sounded. “Where am I?” she cried,
and with sudden remembrance. “Baby—where’s
Baby?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Desmond woke. “Where’s Baby, Dez?” she asked
again piteously, and even as she spoke she heard the
sound of a tiny chuckle, and by her side on a bed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>miniature of the one she was on, lay her baby, crooning
with delight. The bell tinkled again. Desmond
went to the door and opened it slightly. A smiling girl
was outside with a table on wheels. “Your mushti,”
said she wheeling it toward him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To eat?” queried Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course. It is pleasant on the ‘vala,’ outside
among the flowers—have it there with your friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you. It’s breakfast, Mavis,” said Desmond.
“Look out on the balcony and see if Uncle John is
there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis was almost too bewildered to ask any
questions, and obeyed. There was a tiny gate dividing
their balcony from the next, and she went through.
“Uncle John,” she called softly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John, Alan, and Masters appeared at the window
of the next room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’re awake then?” laughed Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you had any food?” asked Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan laughed. “A table each—and chock full.
Shall we wheel ours along and all have it together?”
In a trice the six were sitting down to the first real meal
they had had since they had so miraculously escaped
from the end of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>The tables were of different coloured glass, and were
laden with food very different from that to which they
had been accustomed. There were jugs full of steaming
liquid, neither tea, coffee, nor cocoa, but with a
reminiscent flavour of all three, and extremely refreshing.
There were wines—fruits whole, and fruits
compote. There were cereals served almost like
porridge, and there was bread too. Bread and tiny,
crisp rolls, biscuits sweet and biscuits plain, and pats of
golden butter. It was a delightful meal, refreshing,
invigorating, and so different from the stodgy, unwholesome
tinned meats they had been living on for so long.
There was also a tiny tray for the baby—a bowl of fresh
new milk and some rusks. A plate of a kind of arrowroot
mixture was greatly appreciated by little John
Alan, who cried out “More—pese, mum, more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The little beggar likes it,” said Sir John. “He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>appreciates the change too. Well, here we are all on
land again at last, and among friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are you going to do?” asked Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll throw ourselves on the mercy of the Jovians
of course; make up our minds to settle down in a new
world, and live the remainder of our lives in peace and
contentment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shan’t we ever go home again?” Mavis’s eyes
widened, and she looked imploringly at the others.
The truth was forced on her mind at last. She had no
home! Gone were all her pretty possessions—gone
her trinkets, her books, her silver. Gone also her
delicate trousseau—her frocks, lingerie, jewels.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everything was gone. The world itself had vanished.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, my dear,” said Sir John. “We must
acclimatize ourselves to this new life. After, all, we
can easily do that. We have been treated as honoured
guests, so I must speak to the Jkak, and find out our
future standing in this world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They speak English!” said Alan wonderingly
“How is that? Surely we are the first English people
who have found their way here? There can’t be a
colony of Britishers in Jupiter!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The bell sounded again, and Alan went to the door.
Waz-Y-Kjesta stood outside. “The Jkak is eager to
see you,” said he. “If you feel strong enough and
sufficiently rested, come with me and I will lead you to
him.” They followed him down the stairs to the
entrance hall, and through into a spacious apartment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Reception Room,” said the Waz. “The Jkak
wishes not to be on formal terms with you—he bade me
bring you to his garden room.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Through a doorway they went and out into the most
glorious garden they had ever seen. Fountains
splashed in the sunlight—tiny brooks gurgled over
white stones, as they wound round beds of flowers.
There was a riot of colour in this wonderful garden—glorious,
flowering trees and shrubs abounded—creeper-covered
archways were everywhere, and at the
further end they could see a creeper-covered arbour,
hung with exotic blooms. Inside this were easy
chairs, settees and comfortable lounges. The Jkak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and Mirasu, his Jkakalata, were seated there awaiting
their arrival, and rose to greet them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now tell us your story,” said the Jkak, “for
wonderful it must be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“First,” said Alan, who at Sir John’s request, acted
as spokesman, “how is it you can understand our
language? Surely English isn’t spoken here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“English?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. We are English. We come from that part
of our world that was known as England, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have the ‘gift of tongues’ my friend,” said
the Jkak. “Until we spoke to you, we had never
before heard your tongue, but the moment you spoke
we understood. I cannot describe our gift—it just—is.
We of Keemar all speak one tongue. No confusion
is here. Until you came, we had never had the
opportunity to benefit from this gift we all believed we
possessed. To-day, all Keemarnians are thanking
Mitzor, the Great White Glory and Tower of Help, for
His graciousness in having conferred upon us this gift,
and for allowing us to have the means given us for
using the ‘gift of tongues’. We understand, all of
us. We may not understand every expression you
utter, for things are different in other worlds, and we
ourselves no doubt possess peculiarities of our own—still
we can converse freely with you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a wonderful gift to possess,” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now your story,” insisted the Jkak gently.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Alan told the whole story of his life since the time
when he and Desmond first went to Marshfielden. He
told of the Light, and the people of Kalvar—of their
wonderful escape from the bowels of the earth, and of
the end of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So Quilphis is no more,” said the Jkak. “Indeed,
we witnessed its destruction, and thought that your airship
was part of the planet itself. And so,” he went
on, “you believe that the end of the world was caused
through the failure of the fire in the centre of the
earth?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I feel sure of it,” said Alan. “During our stay in
Kalvar, we noticed that the Fire grew daily less and
less. And the purple people prophesied that when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Fire went out, then would come the end of the world.
I think that, in its last dying gasp, it tried to get a new
lease of life. In its gigantic death struggle, it burst its
bonds, and earthquakes, volcanoes, and water spouts
were the result.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it was horrible,” said Mavis shuddering.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And your ship—the one you sailed in—you must
invite me to see it,” said the Jkak.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, of course,” said Sir John. “Have you not
been?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not mine,” replied the Jkak. “It would be an
impertinence to pry into your affairs without an invitation.
Now, with regard to yourselves. I must see that
you go to Hoormoori and pay your respects to our
Rorka. Hoormoori is the chief place in this world of
ours; it is there that our Rorka has his palace.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rorka?” asked Mavis “What is that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our Rorka rules over the whole of Keemar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you only one Rorka or King over the whole
of Keemar?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, of course. Why should we have more?”
asked Mirasu smiling. “Keemar is one world—with
one Rorka. Then we have one hundred Jkaks, and one
thousand Moritous—that is enough, surely, to govern
a world?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you only one nation then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Naturally. We are all Keemarnians—just one
great nation, divided into many families. We all speak
the same language—all worship in the same fashion
Mitzor, the Great White Glory and Tower of Strength,
and all live in peace, friendship, and harmony, one with
another. But now my friends, strangers though you
are, you are welcome here. I will put at your disposal
houses and serving men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We possess nothing,” said Sir John. “We have
no property, no valuables—nothing but the Argenta.
How shall we repay your kindness to us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Repay?” said the Jkak, “nay, that is another, word
I know not the meaning of.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” began Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, you are strangers in a strange world. It is
our duty to make you all feel at home here. I can see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>you were of high estate in your own country—you must
be of high estate here also. Know you, we are wise in
this land. Our Rorka is first, and his spouse, the
Rorkata, ranks second. Their offspring and nearest
blood relations come next; then come the Jkaks and
Moritous; our Djohs and Ab-Djohs; the Wazi,
Captains of our air birds, our learned men and students,
down to the serving men and maids, and the builders of
our homes and our ships. From highest to lowest, all
share ‘pro rata’ in the good things of the world. We
are all satisfied—the laws of our land have fixed the
rates that are to be paid to each household from the
common fund. I assure you, there will be enough
and to spare for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters spoke for the first time. “I am Sir John’s
servant,” he began.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” corrected Sir John. “Masters is my faithful
friend and adviser.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you would like him to dwell in the same house
with you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please,” said Sir John, “and my nephew Alan,
also.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you, no doubt,” went on the Jkak turning to
Desmond, “you would like to have apartments to yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you,” answered Mavis for her husband and
herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good. I will summon Waz-Y-Kjesta. There are
several new houses near at hand. Go with him—you
can take your choice,” and with a wave of the hand
and a smile, they realized that they were dismissed
from the presence of the Jkak and his charming
wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta was hovering near and came toward
them. He had received his full instructions beforehand.
“Come,” said he. “The houses that are unoccupied
are quite close—come and take your choice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How is it,” asked Alan, “that we can walk so
easily now. When we first came out on to the open deck
of the Argenta, our limbs were as heavy as lead. We
could not walk an inch, and we were so top-heavy we
could hardly stand.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“That is easy to explain,” replied the Waz. “Eight
Kymos have risen since you arrived here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Kymos?” asked Mavis. The Keemarnian names
puzzled her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sun?” suggested Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, you call it—sun. Yes, since you first came,
the sun has sunk seven times. You have slept—breathed
in our air. While you were sleeping, our men
of science administered medicinal gases through your
nostrils. These gases lightened you—took from you
the heaviness of your earth. You will find no difficulty
now,” and he led the way through the garden to the
most glorious street it was possible to imagine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you will see our country,” he continued, “and
compare it with your own. You are not too tired?”
he asked Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, of course not. I feel too excited. I want to
see your beautiful city—your beautiful country. May
I first see that my baby is all right?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He gave the necessary permission, and soon she
returned. “He is sleeping peacefully,” said she.
“Morkaba is watching over him. Now I’m ready,”
and they all went down the marble steps of the Jkak’s
palace, eager for their first sight of this new, strange
land.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>DEATH IN JUPITER</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>They walked down a lovely avenue to the outer gates.
It was grass-covered, soft and velvety and cool. Birds
with the gayest plumage hopped among the branches of
the trees, and came fearlessly up to the strangers. One
bird, perhaps as big as an English bullfinch, of many
colours and with a fan-shaped tail, perched on Mavis’
shoulder, and chirped prettily to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How wonderful!” said she.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did not your, birds do that?” asked Waz-Y-Kjesta.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, they were too nervous.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nervous?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—frightened—terrified,” she explained.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understand the meaning of the word you utter,”
said he, “but you will not find the sensation of fear
known on Keemar. We live in harmony with our birds,
our animals, and even our fish. They are all our
friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the end of the avenue they found themselves on a
broad road. Hills rose up at the side, steeply in some
places, while in others the rise was more gradual,
leaving moorland and valley in view. Houses were
built at intervals along the roads, all of wonderful,
coloured marbles, but they were all surrounded by
beautiful grounds, and added to the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh,” said Mavis suddenly. “There’s a shop.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta looked puzzled, and followed her gaze.
“Oh yes, you mean our Omdurlis. How else should
we get food to eat and clothes to wear?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“How then do you manage about your coinage?
Do you have money?” asked Alan curiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not the word.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you buy things—what do you give in
exchange?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, we have laika—royla, suka and minta,” said
he; and he drew from his purse that hung satchel-wise
across his shoulders, some coins. The first was square,
as large as a five shilling piece, and green in colour.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This will purchase the most,” he said. “Five
roylas make a laika.” The royla was exactly the same,
but no bigger than a florin. “Then there are ten
sukas to a laika, and twenty mintas.” The last two
coins were of a bronze hue and as big as a shilling and
a sixpence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I expect those five coins are equal to a fiver, a
sovereign, a two shilling piece and a sixpence,” said
Mavis thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you get your money?” asked Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, from the Rorka,” explained the Waz. “I am
a Waz—I receive one thousand roylas or two hundred
laikas a murvin. The Jkak will get a thousand laikas,
while little Morkaba, who is born of the workers, gets
but ten and her food.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose the shopkeepers make a lot of money,”
said Desmond.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh no. All members of the Omdurlis get one
hundred laikas. All that they make above that they
are bound to send to the Rorka. He places all the
surplus in the general fund which is held in reserve for
all Keemarnians. As each male Keemarnian reaches
the age when he has seen the Kymo rise three thousand
and thirty times, he journeys to Hoormoori, makes his
bow to the Rorka, and receives from him his manhood.
According to the station in life in which he has been
born, and from which he has sprung, so he learns to
take his part in life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a wonderful system in theory,” said Sir John.
“But how does it work in practice?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is our custom,” was all the reply the Waz made.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But don’t you sometimes find you get dissentient
spirits? Don’t they rebel against this formality?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Don’t they want to make more money than is allowed
by custom? Don’t you sometimes have trouble from
these spirits?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta smiled. “In our books of science we
have read that in other places than ours—there were
troubles like those you name. That man fought man—brother
hated brother—women sorrowed, and children
were rendered homeless. We, in Keemar, know not
the meaning of such things. We are happy; we are
content with our life; why should we complain?”</p>

<p class='c012'>There were no ugly streets and lines of shops in this
wonderful city; but the Omdurlis were to be found here
and there at the edge of the grass covered paths, while
the houses lay further back. Everywhere were to be
seen happy-faced men and women, and laughing
children. Bhors driven by colis, and bhors driven by
the etheric power that was used for lighting and propelling
purposes, thronged the streets, and the whole
scene was gay and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although the sky was a wonderful blue, and all the
buildings were of white and brilliant coloured marbles,
the whole effect had none of the tawdry or bizarre
appearance of the cities of the East, in the world; but
the whole was soothing and pleasing to the jaded nerves
of the earth folks. They turned a corner and found
themselves in a short road ending in a cul-de-sac formed
by high gates and marble pillars.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is one of the houses,” said Waz-Y-Kjesta.
“Come, and see it.” The garden entranced Mavis
before she saw the house. It was like a picture out of
the fairyland she had dreamt of as a child—the fairyland
she had dreamt of as a woman! For are not all
true women half fairies at heart? Is not the mysticism
of life itself a fairy gift to a pure woman’s mind? Mavis
had lived her life among the fairies. As a child she had
played with them in bluebell woods and primrose glades;
and when she renewed her own childhood in her baby,
she renewed through him her acquaintance with the
fairies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Trees overhung the grassy path which was on a
gradual upward slope. Burns ran down on either side—rushing,
laughing, maddening burns. Tiny flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>peeped out among the grass; lichen-covered rocks
reared up majestically from the centre of still pools.
Gnarled trees lined the way, and their twisted roots
formed steps up the hillside. The top spread out
plateau-wise, and a blue marble house was built in the
very centre. It was not very large; a verandah ran
all round it on both floors, and the foliage and creeping
plants added to its beauty. The door was open wide,
and the splashing fountain in the entrance hall looked
inviting and cool. Apart from the kitchen and servants’
quarters, there were on the ground floor only two
living rooms and the entrance hall. Each of the six
bedrooms on the upper floor had magnificent bathrooms
leading from them. They were like miniature swimming
baths, shallow at one end, deepening to six feet, and
the water was hot and cold in the pipes. The whole
house was decorated in a delicate shade of blue, and
was absolutely ready for use. Mavis was entranced.
“May we stay here?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will acquaint the Jkak with your decision,”
answered the Waz. “Now,” turning to Sir John,
“through the garden yonder, and down a short woodland
path is a garden house. Would you care to see
it? It might suit you, and you would be all near to one
another.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It sounds most attractive,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>They walked through the garden and down the hill
on the other side of it, and saw, nestling among the
trees, the tiniest house they had so far seen on Jupiter.
It was an absolutely perfect bachelor establishment, and
the three men decided at once that it was an ideal spot
to live in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Jkak is eager to see your air bird,”
announced Waz-Y-Kjesta. “When may he go?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why I’d forgotten all about the Argenta,” said
Alan. “Can’t we go now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis looked from one to the other. “Do you want
Dez?” she asked pathetically. “I seem to have seen
so little of him lately. Dez come—come home, and
Baby, you and I will have a long, happy day together.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So it was decided that Sir John, Alan and Masters
should go back to the Jkak’s with the Waz, and arrange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>about the trip to the Argenta. “Waiting men and
maids have already been dispatched to your houses,”
announced the majordomo, Marlinok by name.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is the Jkak at liberty?” asked the Waz.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is, my Waz.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell him, if it is his desire, the strangers will show
him their air bird now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A few minutes passed and Marlinok returned. “The
bhors are ready and waiting, my Waz. The Jkak has
already started.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Outside they found two double bhors ready, and Sir
John and his faithful Masters travelled in one, while
Alan and Waz-Y-Kjesta occupied the other. Alan
was now able to enjoy the scenery through which he
passed. The path by which they travelled ran by the
side of an island lake, with tall mountains towering on
the further side of the water. The woodland nature of
the scene with the twining paths and overhanging
branches reminded Alan forcibly of the bank of Loch
Lomond between Tarbet and Ardlui; yet the almost
tropical colouring of the flora—the wonderful brightness
of the birds’ plumage, the waving palm-like trees
that were interspersed here and there, were unlike anything
he had ever beheld. This place seemed to possess
everything to make it perfect—mountain—moorland—water—and
woodlands. Nothing was missing from
this panorama of glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last the Argenta hove in sight, and somehow its
beauty seemed to have lessened in this land of glory.
The silver brightness of its aluminium looked dim in
the golden sunlight; the torpedo-shaped body seemed
ugly and sinister in comparison with the beauty and
symmetry of the Keemarnian air birds. The Jkak
waited for the strangers to alight, and the Waz
whispered his instructions. “Welcome the Jkak, my
friend,” said he. “It is our custom. Ask him to
honour you by boarding your craft. Let him bring
peace and prosperity to your house by stepping across
the threshold of your boat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Jkak,” said Alan, going to the side of the state
bhor, “will you honour us all by boarding our Argenta,
and bring us joy and peace?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“You have learnt your lesson quickly and well, my
son,” said the Jkak in reply. “I will come with
pleasure.” He walked aboard and was extremely
interested in the vessel. “But how do you move it?”
he asked. “How does it rise into the heights of the
heavens?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is the spirit,” said Alan, “but alas, it will not
work in your atmosphere. There seems no power in it.
Perhaps later on, we might experiment with your
etheric current?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jkak and his suite were enchanted with the
fittings of the Argenta—the electricity, the furniture,
the hangings. As they made their way toward the
sleeping cabins, Masters suddenly spoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor old Murdoch—he’s in there,” said he. “I am
afraid I forgot all about him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor chap,” said Alan, “so did I,” and he quickly
barred the way. “May I suggest, my Jkak, that you
do not go in there,” said he. “A very dear comrade
of ours risked his life for us all. He is in there—dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dead?” asked the Jkak.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John bowed his head sadly. “Dead,” he
repeated, “and one of the truest servants that man ever
had.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But if he is in there,” said the Jkak with a puzzled
frown, “why does he not come out?” He looked at
the others in turn. “Why does he not enjoy life with
you? Ah! He thinks the Argenta would not be safe
without him? That is foolish. I will enter—I will
assure him he has nothing to fear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he is dead,” urged Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dead?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, he died before we reached Keemar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not the meaning of the word. The ‘gift
of tongues’ fails me here. Explain—dead.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked at him in amazement. Death was such
a common word in the world; one met with it at every
turn; it was strange that it should remain unknown to
the Jovians with their wonderful “gift of tongues.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“His life has gone,” said Alan simply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But life is eternal, my son.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Surely you do not live for ever on Keemar?”
asked Alan incredulously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, no. We do not live for ever on Keemar it is
true—but our life is eternal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was impossible to explain—they had no knowledge
of death—yet they, on their own showing, seemed to
expect to leave Keemar at some time or other. Surely
death alone could remove them?</p>

<p class='c012'>“I beg of you, do not go in there,” urged Alan, and
he barred the door of the death chamber.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My son,” said the Jkak. “I must know all things
in my country. If what you call ‘death’ has entered—then
I beg you, acquaint me with it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it is horrible—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me meet it face to face—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is loathsome,” urged Alan. “I pray you, do not
go inside.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jkak made no reply, but raised his right hand
high above his head—palm outwards, and even as he
did so, Waz-Y-Kjesta and his suite bent low on one
knee.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The sign of the Jkak,” said the Waz. “His wishes
must be honoured, his commands obeyed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan moved away from the door, his head bowed in
acquiescence, and Marlinok turned the handle of the
door, and stepped back to allow the Jkak to enter.
There was a tense silence for a moment, then from the
darkened chamber came a startled cry, a cry full of
poignant horror, and with an ashen face the Jkak
appeared at the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have seen Death,” said he. “I have seen the
horrors of sin. Death, until now, has never entered
Keemar. Death brings its own punishment. Death
brings horrors and adversity. Death! Oh Great,
White Glory, Tower of Help, Mitzor of our Fathers—I
have seen Death in its hideousness. Mitzor the
Mighty, grant preservation to thy people—grant help
to thy faithful.” Persoph the Jkak was trembling.
His face was white, his hand was shaking as he pointed
to the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What will you do with—with—that?” he asked,
almost inaudibly.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Alan answered him. “Bury him, poor chap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bury?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. Do you not dig graves for your dead?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have no dead, my son. I pray Mitzor, that the
entrance of this—soul—may not bring disaster on our
land. But how do you bury?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan explained, and as he finished the Jkak’s face was
more horror-stricken than before. “Nay, my son,
bury you cannot. That would be impossible here.”
He turned to the Waz. “Does not the Sacrament of
Schlerik-itata take place within eight Kymos?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my Jkak,” answered Y-Kjesta. “Ak-Marn
sent cards for all to attend it. It will be the biggest
feast I have ever known. His seed is mighty, his seed
is great. Five thousand and ten cards have been issued,
and yet five thousand and more still clamour for
admittance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good,” answered Persoph. “This,” pointing
about him, “all this must go. Summon me Misrath,
the High Priest. Bid him bring his ‘waters of purity’
and his smoke of sweet odours. Bid him bring his
choir of young voices, and bid all prepare. A sacrifice
will be offered to Mitzor; the Great White Glory must
be appeased.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan and Sir John were very mystified over the whole
scene. These Jovians did not seem to understand
Death—yet they spoke of sacrifice!</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am sorry, my son,” said the Jkak. “I can save
nothing for you. All must be burnt and offered to
Mitzor. Come now, I will draw a ring around the
contaminated spot, and we will witness the destruction
from without.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John and Alan were both loth to have the Argenta
burnt—but being dependent on the Jovians for their
entire future, they were unable to demur. With a silent
prayer for the friend who had given his life for them,
they left the ship and stood some way off. After an
interminable time of waiting, a mighty blast of music
burst on their ears, and they saw a procession of etheric
bhors coming towards them. The first stopped, and
Misrath the High Priest alighted, followed by priests
and acolytes in quaint garments of ecclesiastical cut.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>A procession formed—two acolytes with censers led
the way, and wafted the glorious perfume from side to
side. Then followed one of the most mystical and
picturesque ceremonies it was possible to imagine.
Almost of Mosaic grandeur, it thrilled the watchers.
They were unable to understand what was being said—all
was in the language of the Keemarnians—but the
meaning was plain. The High Priest offered the
Argenta and its contents to Mitzor, the Great White
Glory. He offered it, with its fine workmanship, its
precious metals—and its body of sin. He asked that
through the mediation of the sacrifice, any evil might
be averted, that the entrance of Death might bring.
He consecrated the Argenta to Mitzor—he consecrated
the ground it contaminated. He poured the “waters
of purity” across its bow, and named it “Meeka,” the
Bringer of Knowledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the Argenta was sprayed from stem to stern
with a milky fluid that dried like little curds all over the
vessel. A torch was lighted and applied to the ship.
Little flames ran along meeting each other until they
merged into one great whole; there was a roar and a
noise like thunder, and the Argenta, the hobby of a life
time, the fruit of patient labour, was no more!</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John watched with a set face, but as the fire died
out, and he saw that the whole had been swallowed up,
had consumed itself entirely,—he crumpled up, and lay
inert upon the ground.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE SACRAMENT OF SCHLERIK-ITATA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Alan bent over his uncle, but the High Priest waved
him away. “Touch him not,” said he sternly, and
such command rang in his tones, that Alan stepped
back involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again the scene was repeated—Sir John was prayed
over, sprayed with the “waters of purity,” and
incensed. As the sweet fumes found their way up his
nostrils, he stirred. Alan rushed to him and embraced
him. “It was only foolishness, Alan,” said he
brokenly. “But the Argenta—my ship—I was so proud
of her. Masters, you know how I felt? She was my
all in my days of sorrow. And in my days of joy, when
reunited we sailed in her, she was my joy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understand, Uncle John. But try not to mind—when
one is in Rome—you know the rest. We are in
Jupiter and we must do as the Jovians wish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Persoph the Jkak, came up to them. “Nay, grieve
not,” said he kindly. “We have cleared this place of
sin. An air bird to take the place of the one that has
gone shall be placed at your disposal. Go you home.
Cards will be brought you for the Sacrament of
Schlerik-itata. I beg of you all—attend it. Nay, I
command you. We will meet again within eight
Kymos. Farewell. Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta, motioned to their bhor. “Come, my
friend,” said he. “I will drive you back another way—we
will drive along the shores of the secti, and watch
the breakers roll in.” The sea shore was wonderful;
the sea was blue, a deep, deep blue, and the breakers,
flecked with foam, rolled in to a golden shore. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>passed bays, promontories, caves and rocks—and they
found the drive of bewildering beauty.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan asked, “What is the Sacrament of Sch—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Schlerik-itata?” supplemented the Waz.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My friend, you must wait until you witness it.
You will understand us more fully when you have been
to the home of Ak-Marn. Now to-night, there is a
small party being given by Kulmervan and his fellow
students at the Observatory. I have been asked to
bring you all. Will you come?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With pleasure,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Jkak is sending you all a complete outfit, my
friend. Your clothes are old, travel-stained and torn—they
are sombre too. If you accept his present, wear
to-night your brightest garments.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will you help me to adjust them?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Waz drew himself up with a haughty air, but it
as soon passed. “I was forgetting, my friend, that
you know not our customs. The serving men will assist
you. When you reach home, you will find your house
fully staffed, and Quori, a most efficient steward and
adviser.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What about meeting to-night for the party?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will call for you as the Kymo sinks. You will
have bhors sufficient for your use.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When they reached home they found a note awaiting
them from Mavis, asking them to come over and have
lunch with her and Desmond, and they walked through
the garden to the other house. Mavis was waiting for
them, her cheeks dimpling and her eyes sparkling.
“It’s a wonderful country,” said she. “I’ve nothing to
do all day; the cooking and cleaning seem to go by
clockwork. Morkaba is Baby’s personal attendant and
mine; she has arranged my frock. How do you like
it?” and she twirled round on one foot showing the
soft draperies of Keemarnian dress.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was of a soft green, embroidered with coloured
silks and her hair was left loose flowing around her
shoulders, and caught above her ears by a narrow fillet
of gold that gleamed as she tossed her head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I like it much better than the frumpy old English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>fashions,” said she. “Desmond is not quite ready yet—he
will look splendid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall change later,” said Sir John, “and I shall
be glad to get out of these stuffy and dirty garments.
All the same I don’t fancy myself a cross between an
imitation gladiator and a stained glass twelfth century
saint.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They thoroughly enjoyed their meal; eggs served in
a wonderful salad of fruit and vegetables proved to be
the staple part, and this course was followed by a baked
grain, similar to barley, but of a bright green colour,
deliciously creamy and sweet. There was milk to
drink, and plenty of heavy cream.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They seem to be almost vegetarians here,” said
Mavis, “for although we have had plenty of milk,
eggs and cream, I have not seen a sign of fish or
meat.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the better,” said Sir John, “after all that tinned
stuff while we were on the Argenta—ugh!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They drove in state to the students’ party. The Waz
had constituted himself their guide, and they were very
thankful for his services. The large ground floor of
the Observatory had been converted into a veritable
bower of roses. At one end, almost hidden by flowers,
were the musicians—playing dreamy music on soft-toned,
stringed instruments.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Host in Chief, Kulmervan, with Waiko, stood on
a raised dais at one end and received their guests, who
were all announced by an usher who wore a kilt-like
shirt and a flowing cape. As the strangers entered he
announced from a card they gave him, first in his own
language and then in English, “Sir John, Alan,
Desmond, Masters, and Mavis.” No surnames were
known on Jupiter, and so far they possessed no
Keemarnian title. To Sir John they gave his prefix,
although they did not quite understand it.</p>

<p class='c012'>A great silence reigned when the announcement was
made—Kulmervan left the dais and advanced toward his
guests, and this mark of homage was acknowledged by
clamorous cheers from all the others who were present.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Welcome,” said he. “I witnessed your descent
upon our land. Indeed, it was I who helped to focus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>our ray of attraction upon your vessel and helped to
draw you into our atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are your rays?” asked Alan. “Surely you
had never any cause to use one before?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, yes, my friend. Some time ago, some of
our Keemarnians, while experimenting in the Heavens,
found themselves outside our atmosphere. They never
returned. Across the roadway between the red planet
‘Mydot’—Mars I think you call it—and ourselves, are
many rapidly moving meteoric bodies. We fear that
our gallant brothers met one of these, and were
destroyed. Many men of science went after these lost
ones but none ever returned. Through our wonderful
glass, we saw one of our air birds in space; it was
unable to reach home. Then was the great magnetic
ray discovered. In the shortest space of time it was
perfected, and played on the silent air bird. Gradually
it was drawn nearer and nearer to our shores until it
was within our atmosphere, and was able to land in
safety. Since that time, if air birds venture too high,
we have nearly always been able to save the adventurous
spirits, and in your case, we brought you safely here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a wonderful invention,” said Sir John, “and I
can imagine would have been of immense value to our
airmen on earth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan then presented them to Waiko, and Mavis
was led to a seat of honour on the dais.</p>

<p class='c012'>They spent a most enjoyable time, and the whole
entertainment was very like what they were accustomed
to on earth. Games were played,—games with balls
and racquets, and balls and hoops, and between the
games there was singing and dancing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Refreshments were served in a hall adjoining, and
consisted mainly of luscious fruits and dainty cakes and
pastries. The many Keemarnians they met, invited
them in turn to parties and entertainments, and they felt
they had more invitations than they could safely accept.
“Never accept,” whispered Waz-Y-Kjesta to them all,
“unless you mean to honour your host with your
presence. A refusal never offends, but to accept and
then to disappoint, is unforgivable.” Suddenly in the
middle of the dancing a trumpet blew loud and clear.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The band ceased and the couples stood still. Then
rang out a fanfare of royal welcome, and the guests
rushed to the entrance hall in great excitement, waving
and cheering. “It must be some one of importance
who is coming,” said Desmond. “Perhaps it is the
Rorka,” suggested Mavis. There was a roll of drums,
and then, on a litter carried by six stalwart men, entered
a girl of perhaps eighteen years. The cortége stopped
and Kulmervan bent low before her, and kissed her
proffered hand. She bowed ever so slightly, and he
assisted her from her cushioned throne. She stood
beside him, and proved to be quite small, not more than
five feet in height, but of a beauty almost indescribable.
She was very fair and fragile. Her eyes were
purple-blue fringed with long, black lashes. Her fillet
was of gold, and was enriched with gems the colour of
her eyes, while her robe of blue hung in folds about her.
Perhaps it was her lips that impressed the watchers
most. A perfect bow—they were of a vivid scarlet that
contrasted strangely with the delicate pink flush of her
cheeks. Self possessed, calm and regal she looked as
she graciously acknowledged the plaudits of the
guests.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is she, Alan?” asked Mavis. But he was
unconscious of her question, he could only gaze and
gaze at the beautiful apparition who had come so unexpectedly
upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waiko bent in turn before the stranger who
whispered something to him. Immediately he came
toward Mavis. “We are honoured to-night,” said he.
“The Ipso-Rorka Chlorie has journeyed from Pyrmo
to welcome you. She heard of your presence and came
at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is she?” asked Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why the highest lady in the land—the only child of
our Rorka.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis went toward where the girl stood, and the
Ipso-Rorka held out both her hands to the English girl.
“Welcome,” said she, in a voice musical and low. “I
hear you start soon to honour the Rorka, my father,
with a visit. May I welcome you first?” In turn the
others were presented to her, but her attention was all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>for Mavis—it was Mavis the woman she wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c012'>And Alan? He had seen his ideal! Years before,
he wondered whether he would ever meet her—and now
he had. And a King’s daughter! And he a stranger
in a strange world! How dare he even lift his eyes
toward her. Yet he dared—and his pulses leapt madly
as his eyes feasted on her beauty. Not once did she
address him—not once did she even seem to notice him.
Chlorie put her hand lightly on Desmond’s arm. “I
will dance with you,” said she smiling, and Alan
watched them lead the merry throng of dancing couples.
The demon of jealousy, earth jealousy, was in his heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why are you looking so—how can I put it—so
sad?” asked Kulmervan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan laughed. “He has a wife,” he muttered.
“Why does he take her from others?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But she has honoured him. It is not for us to
choose for the Ipso-Rorka,” said Kulmervan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but she is so beautiful, so sweet, so glorious,”
began Alan. Then he stopped suddenly. “Oh,” he
continued, “what do you people of Jupiter know of love
or hate? Your lives are too quiet, too humdrum to
know aught of passion—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Teach me! Teach me!” cried Kulmervan leaning
toward him. “Your face is drawn—your eye hard.
Yet you look as if you could battle with the world.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Love and hate,” said Alan grimly. Then he
laughed. “What a fool I am. Desmond is my
cousin; we love each other like brothers. He has won
Mavis—why should he not dance with the Ipso-Rorka?
Mavis does not mind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Kulmervan turned away in silence. Knowledge
had come to him in a curious way. He saw passion,
love, hatred, anger, jealousy all raging within a human
heart. Unconsciously the feelings were photographed
upon his too sensitive mind. Love that had only
smouldered was now born in all its fury for the Princess
Chlorie, the fair. And with love was born the twin,
hate—hate for Alan, the man he feared might supplant
him.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>It seemed as if death, although burned and purified,
had brought into Keemar unrest and sin. The prayers
of the High Priest himself were unable to wash it away,
until scourged and purified the earth folk themselves
became less material and more godlike and true.</p>

<p class='c012'>The day for the Sacrament of Schlerik-itata arrived at
last and the strangers found themselves on the way to
Ak-Marn’s palace.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although the Aks had no administrative powers, as
had the Jkaks, they were held in the highest esteem,
for they were princes of royal blood.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ak-Marn greeted them warmly. They saw that his
dress was different from the usual male costume. He
was in unrelieved white, and wore neither jewel nor
ornament. The material of his robe, which hung with
a long cloak to the ground, was almost like plush and
there was something almost bridal about the costume.
Yet Ak-Marn was an old man, with a beard of white,
and grandchildren in plenty. Surely Schlerik-itata could
not be the same as matrimony, thought Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>The guests were eight thousand in number, and all
wore their brightest jewels and their finest raiment.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was singing and dancing and much gay chatter,
and the whole scene was one of wonderful gaiety and
joy. Refreshments were brought in, and Ak-Marn
began to speak. The English people could now understand
the Keemarnian language fairly well. It was
easy, its grammar simple, and its pronunciation almost
Latin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friends,” said Ak-Marn. “I break bread with
you. Two and ten Kymos have sunk since I quenched
my thirst or satisfied my hunger. I’ve prayed to
Mitzor, the Great White Glory and Tower of Help, to
prepare me for my journey. My call came eighty and
five Kymos since—I saw the figures in fire. I heard my
call, and am prepared. I go with hope in my heart—with
joy in my breast. I am to be envied, my friends,
for my days have been long upon Keemar. I leave my
loved one, Viok, and our children, and our children’s
children in your care, my friends. When I am gone,
cheer her with loving words—help her with kind
counsel. I leave you with love in my heart. I leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>you with the knowledge that our parting is not for long.
Soon you will join me in the home of the Tower of
Help. Remember that the eternities of time cannot
be measured.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then bread was broken, and there followed the
“Feast of the Sacrament,” and the most intimate
friends of Ak-Marn drank to his “future”—drank to
his coming “joy.” And Alan and Sir John were no
longer mystified. They realized that what they in their
materialism knew as “Death” was nigh—but not
Death, the slayer of happiness, Death, the dread reaper,
but Death in a kindly form, a death that gave life—a
death that was glorious.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought at first that the Jovians were of a finer
nature than ours,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If they have conquered Death, they must indeed be
high,” said Sir John thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is Mitzor?” asked Mavis.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The God of our Fathers, my dear. The God of
Abraham and the God of the New Testament. Whatever
their religion and ritual is, they worship the same
God as we do,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When the feast was ended, the guests, one by one,
bade farewell to their host. It was a long tedious
business, as no one was permitted to pass without at
least a few personal words from Ak-Marn who was
seated on a raised chair near the doorway. And as
each woman passed out, she was crowned with a wreath
of beautiful, freshly cut flowers, from which hung a
filmy white veil, while the men were given long white
cloaks with hoods which they drew over their bare
heads. Mavis bent her knee, and held out her hands
to the kindly old man. “My child,” said he. “Our
beautiful ceremony is so far meaningless to you. Go
home—pray to Mitzor the Mighty that He may refine
and cleanse you, that when your time comes you may
be reincarnated to Him, through the medium of his
Sacrament. Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To Alan he spoke long and quietly. “My son,” said
he, “you are in a strange world, you are young, you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>carnal. Ah,” as Alan would have protested, “we of
Keemar, my Alan, are not as of your world. We know
not sin as you know it. Our first parents, Menlin and
Jorlar, were placed in a garden—” Alan started—“Yes,
my friend, as your parents were. They
succumbed not to temptation—so they lived in happy
solitude for many years. Then Mitzor in His great
kindness gave them the knowledge of Love—Love without
sin. They mated. Their love grew. Children of
love were born sinless into our world. Child bearing
was a glory; motherhood the highest estate. They
knew neither sin nor sorrow, and so in love our
populace grew.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you mean to say you are sinless here?” asked
Alan incredulously.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My son, it is not an estate for us to glory in, for
the merits do not belong to us, but to our first parents.
No—real sin has never entered here, but we live in
dread of its coming. In a far off country—in Fyjipo—there
is built a large palace behind high walls. If
anger, or lust, or impatience is shown by any one of
us, an order is given and the offender is taken to the
Hall of Sorrows to purge away his sins. Should a
madness come upon us, for such we reckon these failings
to be—we are kept safe until it has passed, and
until we can no longer contaminate our fellow
creatures.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a wonderful country,” said Alan. “Where we
come from, is all sin and misery and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, tell me not. I go on a journey. I shall
face my Mitzor. I charge you, should you or your
friends feel this madness coming on you, hide
yourselves, I beg, in the Hall of Sorrows. Stay there
until it has passed, and preserve the purity and
happiness of this land. Farewell.” The cloak was
fastened round Alan’s shoulders, and he too left the
kindly presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta was waiting for them at the outer
hall. “Go home,” he whispered. “Your bhor
awaits you. I beg of you, eat no more this night,
but in the early dawn, while Kymo still sleeps, put
on your cloaks, and the Lady Mavis her veil, and go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>you to the Temple of Mitzor. Farewell.” It was a
very solemn party that retired to their rooms that
night, yet the full mystery of the Sacrament had not
been unfolded to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was dark when they arose, and in a dim twilight
they drove to the Temple. They had never before
been inside it, and it was with much trepidation that
they waited on the threshold. It was a very beautiful
building of pale blue marble—the colour of the sky.
An enormous dome rose up in the centre of the
square body of the Temple, and at the four corners,
minarets with gilded tops finished the picture. A
flight of fifty steps led up to the doors which were
of a burnished metal, and studded with precious gems.
Just inside was an antechamber, where the guests
waited in silence until they were ushered to the seats
that were allotted to them. The inside was wonderful.
Mosaic walls representing allegorical tales gleamed
in the dim light; the roof was of gold, and marble
pillars supported it down the long aisle. An enormous
altar rose up at the further end upon which were
carved in marble cherubim and seraphim. In the
sanctuary, if such it could be called, was a small
white throne of marble, with heavy, white curtains
draped at either side. It was placed in such a
position that although it did not intercept the view
of the altar, which was high above the nave, yet it
could be seen by every one in the building.</p>

<p class='c012'>The seats allotted to Alan and his party were very
near the front where rails of gold separated the
Sanctuary from the people’s part of the Temple.
Music floated on the air—soft like babbling brooks
and the song of birds; now bursting out into
thunderous praise and mighty worship.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly there came a solemn hush; a bell tinkled;
the organ played softly, and there came the sound
of boys’ sweet voices raised in ecstasy: from a door
at the side of the choir a dozen acolytes walked
dressed in their garments of white. The procession
started down the nave. After these boys came priests
and deacons, and then Misrath, the High Priest
walked in front of a raised throne. On this sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Ak-Marn, his eyes closed and his hands clasped in
prayer. Behind him walked his wife and their
children. Their faces were radiant, it is true; yet
there was a touch of sadness in his wife’s gait. Then
followed more priests and acolytes, all singing hymns
of joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>The procession wound round the Temple, and back
through the middle aisle, and through the rails into
the Sanctuary. Ak-Marn was led to the marble
throne; his wife alone of his family had followed close
behind, and now his arms were around her. Their
lips met in one long kiss, then with a bowed head she
left his side, and took her place with her family in
the very front seats.</p>

<p class='c012'>The organ thundered. Voices rang in a mighty
pæan of praise. Then silence! Misrath came
forward and offered prayers to Mitzor—prayers of
offering, prayers of supplication. A mighty wreath
of freshly cut flowers was placed upon the altar. It
was to be a burnt offering, and as the smoke of the
sacrifice arose on the air, the white curtains were
drawn around the figure of Ak-Marn and he was
hidden from view. Then singing rent the air;
the acolytes incensed the throne, until it was entirely
covered by the perfumed smoke, covered like a pall.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan watched in wonder. The grandeur of the
prayers, the singing, the mystic curtains drawn
around Ak-Marn appalled him. Misrath’s voice rose
above the music.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Children of Keemar,” he intoned. “One more
brother has been caught by the mantle of Mitzor,
and has left this world for ever. He has gone to
Glory, gone to Happiness—gone to Mitzor Himself.
Peace be unto his house. Peace be unto his wife.
Peace be unto his seed for ever. We bid him—farewell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a great silence. The censers were stilled.
Gradually the smoke of the incense cleared away from
the marble throne, now gleaming in the rising rays
of the Kymo.</p>

<p class='c012'>Misrath touched the cords of the enveloping curtain,
and drew them back. The little white throne was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>empty! Ak-Marn had returned to the bosom of his
Creator! But stay! On the floor, as if shed in the
hurried flight of its owner, lay the bridal robe of
Ak-Marn. The High Priest raised it, blessed it,
sprinkled it with the waters of purity, and Ak-Marn’s
wife received it in her arms. Then the mighty
congregation rose and sang one last song of praise,
and at the end, quietly left the building. And the
last view Alan had of Ak-Marn’s wife was of a solitary
figure, dressed like a bride, clasping the little white
throne that was the last resting place of her loved one.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t understand,” whispered Mavis hoarsely,
as they were being driven back to their home.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear, he is dead,” said Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dead? If that is Death, then it is something to
welcome and not to dread,” she answered softly.
There was a faraway look in her eyes. “What a
wonderful Sacrament! Death that is no sorrow—only
a parting for a little while, and then—reunion.”
She clasped her husband’s hand. “Belovèd,” she
murmured, “if Death comes to us like that, then can
we have no real sorrow any more. Its shadow
cannot cause us pain or grief. What do you think,
Alan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Alan did not answer. He was thinking of two
deep blue eyes, a laughing mouth, wilful golden curls
that flirted on two soft, pink cheeks. He was longing
to crush the lithe and sweet body close to his, and
smother her roses with kisses. The knowledge and
fear of Death had lapsed; Jupiter had eradicated it,—but
with its extinction had come love. Love,
stronger a thousandfold than Death. He looked
upward to where the Sun, Kymo in all his glory, was
shining. The whole world was bathed in a glory of
light. Yes, Jupiter had conquered death, and before
him lay life and love!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>HATRED ON KEEMAR</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Marlinok, the Jkak’s majordomo, called on Sir
John and Alan a few days after they had witnessed
the Sacrament of Schlerik-itata. “Will you be
ready,” he asked them, “when the Kymo is at the
full, to start on your journey to Hoormoori to render
homage to the Rorka?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are we all to go?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But one of you need go,” he answered. “The
Rorka will visit Minniviar later, and then the other
strangers may make their bows.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am glad of that,” said Sir John, “for I should
like to stay here in quietness and retirement for a
little while. I am beginning to feel the burden of my
age, and am worn out with the strain of the last
few years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will go to Hoormoori,” announced Alan, “I
can start at whatever time the Jkak thinks best.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has prepared incense and jewels for you to
take as gifts from the absent ones,” said Marlinok,
“if you will now see Waz-Y-Kjesta all your
arrangements can be made.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go now,” said Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was going down a pretty lane toward where
the air birds were housed when he suddenly became
aware of footsteps behind him. He turned—immediately
the footsteps ceased, and he could see
no one. Thinking he must be mistaken, and fearing
nothing from the Keemarnians, he went on his way
blithely. The air was deliciously warm, and the fresh
breeze, balmy with the scent of flowers, tempered it.
Still the footsteps followed with monotonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>regularity; as he hastened, so they became quicker;
as his died down, so they ceased altogether. Yet he
had no sense of fear, no feeling of impending evil;
the thought of peril on Keemar was impossible to
imagine. The Keemarnians were of a breed as
different from the earth to which he belonged, as he
was from Heaven! He passed delightful homely
fields, gleaming with buttercups and daisies. Friendly
cows chewed the cud in sleepy enjoyment. They did
not rise as he drew near, but only raised their sleepy
heads, and looked at him out of their liquid eyes
with interest and friendliness. A pig grunted in a
corner as she suckled her squealing young; a donkey
brayed; a couple of goats were nibbling the grass
while their kids frolicked near them. He saw strange
animals too. There was the gorwa of the deer family,
a beautiful creature, the colour of a Scottish stag, and
its counterpart in miniature, but with none of its
brother’s timidity. All the animals on Keemar were
of a smaller build than those he had been accustomed
to. The cows were even smaller then the little fawn
Jerseys so valued in England. He had seen terriers
and bull dogs, dalmatians and spaniels in this strange
world, and the bigger breeds were all represented on
a smaller scale. The Jkak had a dog—a Borzoi,
Alan would have called it, yet perhaps it was no bigger
than a small Irish terrier; but strangely enough, its
beauty was not diminished by its minuteness. So
Alan went on. The way was strange to him, but he
was enjoying the calmness of the scene, and he knew
his excellent bump of locality would sooner or later
lead him to Y-Kjesta. Again the footsteps beat time
with his own, and anxious for companionship, he
stepped into the shadow of a tree, and hoped to
waylay a shy, but friendly stranger. A second passed.
The footsteps had ceased—then came a rustling, and
the head of Kulmervan the Student appeared over a
honeysuckle bush. Silently he came forward, alert
and watchful until he was on a level with Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hullo!” said Alan amiably. “Where are you
going, Kulmervan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The effect was magical! Kulmervan jumped as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>though he had been struck, and his face whitened.
He remained silent. “I’m going to see Waz-Y-Kjesta,”
went on Alan. “Are you coming my way?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan did not reply, but a baleful light gleamed
in his eyes, and his mouth twitched.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What’s the matter?” asked Alan curiously.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly Kulmervan spoke, and there was a wealth
of passion in his tones. “Why did you come here,
you strangers? I was happy until you came. I was
contented. You have made me want—want the
unknown. You have stirred my heart and filled it
with longings that I cannot yet fathom. Why have
you come to stir up misery among a happy and
contented race?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alan, “I
have done nothing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ve done everything. You dared to raise
your eyes to the level of Chlorie, our Ipso-Rorka.
You put thoughts about her into my head. Oh—” as
Alan would have broken in—“I read your
thoughts, it was easy, my friend. You dared to
think of her as a woman—even your woman. It was
an impertinence, I tell you. I love Chlorie with my
whole soul, and before Mitzor the Mighty, I’ll carry
her away into some far off land, before she can look
with a favourable eye on a man, not only of another
world, but a man of a coarser nature than our
own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan was breathless when he finished, for
his words had come thick and fast, tumbling over
themselves in his great excitement. Alan was
speechless, and looked as he felt, absolutely uncomfortable
and ill at ease. “Why your very pose
proves guilt,” continued Kulmervan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why should I not love Chlorie?” demanded Alan,
“Why should my love for her cause strife between
us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because, my stranger, I am a Prince of the
Rorka’s House. I am not only Kulmervan the
Student; but Taz-Ak of the House of Pluthoz. Why
else would Chlorie have honoured my party—why else
come to the dance of a student? There are but four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Keemarnians that Chlorie can marry, and I rank
second.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan wondered at the time why the Princess should
come in so natural a manner to the Student’s reception.
He wondered at the time at her familiarity with
Kulmervan. She had patted his hand, smiled into his
eyes, and had honoured him more than once with
a dance.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Alan, too, was in love. Idiotically, insanely in
love with a woman who had not even troubled to
raise her eyes to his, at his presentation. His pulses
throbbed at the remembrance of the touch of her
fingertips as he raised them to his lips. He loved
her, and in that moment was born a desire to overcome
all obstacles, and princess or no princess, to win
her. But he knew too that in this pleasant land of
Keemar an enmity had come upon him, and
wondered whether the Curse of Death had brought it.
He wondered whether the dead and decomposed body
of their faithful Murdoch had indeed brought sorrow
to this fair land.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve spoken to your Ipso-Rorka only once,” said
he. “The night of your party. She has called on
my uncle and Mavis. Mavis has been out driving
with her several times. But I, unfortunately, have
missed her each time. Surely you are not jealous
because I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Because you love her? I am,” said Kulmervan
thickly, “and I say this—if you so much as dare to
raise your eyes to her, if you dare to address her,
I’ll make you suffer for it—aye, even though I also
suffer eternally for it,” and with that he turned on
his heel and walked quickly away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was very perturbed about this meeting, and
felt inclined to tell the story of it to Waz-Y-Kjesta,—yet
the sacred feeling he had for Chlorie was not
to be spoken of, or bandied about from man to man.
No, he would keep it to himself, and trust to time
and common sense to cure Kulmervan of his strange
hatred.</p>

<p class='c012'>He walked quickly on, and already could see the
air birds in the distance, circling above their houses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The little lane turned quickly at right angles—there
was a steep descent, and hedges rose at either side
to a height of six or seven feet, while the overhanging
branches of the trees met in the middle and
formed a leafy arch. The grassy banks were
carpeted with flowers, and the scent hung sweet on
the air. Again the narrow path turned sharply to
the right, and before Alan realized it, there almost at
his feet, stretched across almost the full width of the
path, lay a lion, full grown, with his shaggy mane
stirring in the breeze. Alan stopped suddenly, and his
heart beat quickly. The lion’s eyes were closed—he
was sleeping.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Englishman was almost afraid to move lest
the savage beast should spring upon him and devour
him. He looked round to the right, the bough of a
tree hung low over the path. He leapt up the bank,
and with one mighty spring caught hold of it, and
swarmed up to a topmost branch.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was safe—but the sudden sound had startled the
lion, who rose up and with a low growl prowled
backward and forward beneath the tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was an uncomfortable position to be in—the tree
bough was very thin, and bent and twisted and
crackled ominously. Still the King of Beasts
remained sentinel underneath. Alan felt the perspiration
on his face as the limb shivered and bent, yet
there was no other to which he could move. Still
the animal remained near, his quickened senses no
doubt wondering at the noise he heard, and waiting
to see what had caused it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The minutes dragged by—the branch was weakening
perceptibly—he could already see the white of the
inside where the branch was gradually tearing away
from the parent trunk. There was no one in sight,
and still the lion walked restlessly to and fro.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Kymo was sinking rapidly. It was already
low down on the horizon, and Alan knew he had been
about two English hours in his perilous position. He
saw a branch above his head, and he wormed his way
along to see if he could in any way reach it.
Carefully he went—slowly—suddenly with a scream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and a crash the branch gave way, and Alan felt
himself being hurled to the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>The distance was not great, and he landed in the
centre of some sweet-smelling, soft bushes. He was
dazed, and wondered when the lion would pounce.
He knew he was powerless to help himself. He
heard the pad, pad, of its feet; he could hear the sharp
intake of its breath—then the thing was upon him.
He shut his eyes and waited.—Nothing happened
but the snuffing of the wild beast, and a gentle nosing
as it examined the stranger.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan opened his eyes. The animal was sitting on
its haunches surveying him, and he felt there was
amusement in the beast’s eyes as it watched him. He
moved slightly—still the beast watched motionless.
He raised himself up from the encircling bushes and
clambered down. He knew he would have to face
the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly a voice hailed him, and he saw Waz-Y-Kjesta
coming round the bend in the lane. “Stand
back,” he cried. “There’s a lion here—he may
spring!” But the Waz came on fearlessly. Alan
was petrified, his tongue was parched, no sound came
from his lips. He watched the Waz in frozen horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Keemarnian was smiling. “Where have you
been, my friend? You are late—very late. I thought
you had missed your way, so I came to seek you.”
He was now within three feet of the lion. “What is
the matter? Why are you so grave? Has aught
affrighted you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan pointed to the tawny beast. His hand was
shaking. Surely the farce must end soon, the lion
spring, and tragedy culminate the play.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why Maquer,” said the Waz affectionately, “what
are you doing here? You seldom visit us, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The lion moved toward him, and rubbed his great
head against the Keemarnian’s leg, while Y-Kjesta
talked to him and petted him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He’s tame then?” gasped Alan with a rush of
relief. “You know him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my friend. I’ve never seen this Maquer
before—they generally stay in rocky places.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“But he is so friendly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All beasts are friendly here, my Alan. What—would
Maquer have hurt you on your Earth?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Alan laughingly told of his fright at the lion.
He had learnt one more truth about Keemar—there
were no savage animals upon it. Of a truth, it was a
perfect land!</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta was highly amused at his friend’s
story, and together they went toward the air birds.
The Keemarnian airships were indeed wonderful
creations. White and gold, they were shaped like
swans, with graceful wings outspread, gleaming in the
light. They were made of a mixture of wood and
metal, and contained accommodation for perhaps forty
passengers, as well as the Waz in command, and a staff
of ten. Although not as big as the ill-fated Argenta,
the Keemarnian airship was possessed of a speed
nearly thrice as great.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is the Chlorie,” said Y-Kjesta, “and our
fastest bird. The Jkak has given orders that you are
to choose your own vessel, so perhaps you would like
to see over some others?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” said Alan, looking at the blue hangings, and
seeing in them the reflection of his love’s eyes. “No,
this one will do beautifully.” And the Waz was
impressed by the easy way in which his friend was
pleased. He little realized that it was the name of
the vessel—the Chlorie—that attracted him. And in
the strangeness of it Alan tried to read his fate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll go for a short cruise,” said the Waz, “and
go back to the landing stage Minniviar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was not a cloud in the sky, and the warmth
from the sun’s rays was pleasant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can’t understand how you benefit so considerably
from the sun, your Kymo,” said Alan. “Let me see,
you must be at least five times further away from the
sun than we were on our earth, yet instead of your
light and heat being reduced to about one twenty-fifth
of our supply, you appear to benefit to exactly
the same degree.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, my friend, that is easy to explain. Dark
clouds hover outside our globe—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Yes, bands of vapour,” corrected Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well—vapour. These bands completely encircle
our world. They are saturated with a composition
of gas, sulphuric ether I think you would call it. Well,
this gas acts as a trap to the sun’s rays. It admits the
solar rays to our planet but prevents their withdrawal.
Therefore it permits the heat to enter, but prevents
its escape.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Consequently we get the maximum of light, and
an equable temperature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you then, have no seasons here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Seasons?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Spring or Winter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh yes, it is cold at the poles—very cold, but as
we get nearer to the equator it becomes warmer, and
hardly varies. You see, my Alan, our world differs
from yours. The axis of rotation is almost perpendicular
to our orbit, consequently we are not
subject to seasons as you were in Quilphis.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I didn’t know that before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We too, are more flattened at each end—indeed,
there are many differences between our world that is,
and yours that was.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you ever have rain here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my Alan. How else would plants live and
crops thrive? But again, we do not suffer from
excesses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But don’t you have hurricanes that last from six
to seven weeks? Surely those are excesses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurricanes? I do not know the word.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurricanes—winds—tornadoes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why they affect only the polar regions, and
nothing lives there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” laughed Alan “I think your world is a
great improvement on ours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The scenery they passed on this pleasure trip was
very varied, but very similar to the world he knew at
its best. Here he could imagine he was in the highlands
of Scotland with its crags and hills and torrents.
There in Southern France with its vineyards sloping to
the river’s edge. Again, the warmth of colouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>suggested the tropics, and the next moment they were
flying over great inland arms of a sea, that were
reminiscent of the fjords of Norway.</p>

<p class='c012'>They descended at last, and went to the Jkak to
bid him farewell. There a surprise awaited Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My son,” said the Jkak. “Our Ipso-Rorka has
decided to travel in the Chlorie to Hoormoori. She
desires to reach her father’s side without any more
delay. Taz-Ak Kulmervan has obtained permission
from his kinswoman to attend her on her journey.
But you need have no fear, my Alan. I doubt whether
you will even see the Princess. She will keep within
the precincts of her apartments, and will be attended
exclusively by her maid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan felt distressed. Should he tell the Jkak of
his encounter with Kulmervan? Had he obeyed his
first impulse and confided in the kindly old man, he
would have saved both himself and Chlorie from
much suffering. As it was—well, who can tell
which is always the right course to take? Errors
are made, and paid for in suffering, even in a Perfect
World.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it far, my Jkak, to Hoormoori?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forty Kymos will take you there.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forty Kymos—about twenty of our earth days!
It is quite a long way then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, my friend, you have no idea of the size of
our planet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet you are all one nation—with the same
customs and religion and speech! It is hard to
comprehend, my Jkak, for at home on our little
islands, we were composed of four distinct races.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Ipso-Rorka will board the Chlorie immediately,”
said the Jkak. “Now Mitzor be with you.
Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was no sign of the Princess when Alan
boarded the ship, neither was Kulmervan to be seen,
but he was surprised to find Waiko lounging on the
deck. He gave Alan a cursory nod of recognition as
he passed, but did not rise or offer any greeting.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t you know Waiko?” asked Y-Kjesta in
some surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“Why of course. I met him at Kulmervan’s
party.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then why does he not rise and greet you according
to Keemarnian custom? You have broken bread with
him—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Y-Kjesta, don’t say any more. I—I think
I understand, and perhaps it’s my fault. Let it pass.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As you will, my Alan.” The Chlorie rose, soared
gracefully over the marble buildings of Minniviar, then
tilting her nose, climbed swiftly.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Princess remained in her cabin, her doors
were closed, and the balconies round her apartment
shuttered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ought I to pay my respects to the Ipso-Rorka?”
asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta looked at him in horror. “Nay,
my friend. It is not seemly to address our Ipso-Rorka
unless she summons you first. She has given
strict orders that she is not to be disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So! Kulmervan had begun his work of revenge.
Darkness fell, and Alan retired to his little cabin.
There were few on board, ten souls in all, and the
whole place was wrapped in stillness. All the same he
felt very restless—the four moons of Jupiter were
shining brightly; they were now passing over a sea,
and the moonbeams were playing on the rippling
waters. He rose, dressed himself, and was about to
leave his cabin, when he heard a faint movement outside.
His senses were quickened, he felt for the first
time since his entrance into this new world, a feeling
of impending danger.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a second his mind was made up—quickly he
placed a cushion on his couch and covered it over with
rugs: in the semi-darkness it almost showed the curves
of a living body. The door latch rattled softly, and
Alan slipped behind the folds of a heavy silken curtain.
Softly the door opened, until it was just wide enough
to permit the passage of a man’s body. Alan peered
through the curtain opening and saw that it was
Kulmervan who had entered.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Keemarnian stepped over to the couch and
touched the coverlet. “He’s asleep,” he whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>in his own language, and Waiko entered softly.
“Have you the spray?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, my Kulmervan—but is it necessary? I’m
afraid—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fool,” hissed Kulmervan. “The spray.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waiko handed him a long piece of tubing, the end
of which was fastened to a small bulb. Kulmervan
laid the nozzle end on the bed—there was a slight
hissing sound, and the room became sweet with a
subtle scent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quick,” whispered Kulmervan to his accomplice,
“hasten, lest the fumes overpower us,” and the two
hurriedly left the chamber closing the door tightly
behind them.</p>

<p class='c012'>The air was already heavy, and Alan felt a
drowsiness coming over him. With a mighty effort
he opened the window and leant out. It was a battle
royal between the fumes and the fresh air. Alan felt
his head reel and his senses swim, but the pure night
air conquered, and the little cabin was soon free of
its poison.</p>

<p class='c012'>Silently Alan sat until the dawn broke, thinking over
the strange problem that had presented itself to him.
He had made an enemy, unwittingly it is true, but an
enemy who would stop at nothing in order to further
his ends. He wondered what effect the powerful
fumes would have had upon him. In a land where
there was no death, could life be taken? What would
have happened to him had he inhaled them? He was
determined to ask Waz-Y-Kjesta at the first opportunity.
Suddenly from without a cheery voice hailed
him. It was the Waz.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How did you sleep, my friend?” and he entered
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well indeed,” said Alan, glibly lying.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I slept badly, my Alan. I had evil dreams of you.
I saw you lying—serquor—oh!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is serquor?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is the worst thing that could befall us on
Keemar, my friend. Seldom it happens—but once in
a lifetime. The body stiffens, sleep comes from which
one never awakens. Life is, to all intents and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>purposes, extinct. Yet the body does not melt into
nothingness, as at the Sacrament of Schlerik-itata.
It remains on earth, cut off from the living, cut off
from those already in glory,—useless, desolate,
alone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What causes it?” asked Alan eagerly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sometimes a blow or a fall—or it can be produced
artificially by inhaling morka, a gas used in the weaving
of our silks. The workers wear shields over their
mouths when using it, and are very careful. Never
have I known such an accident to occur, but it could.
It was thus I dreamt of you, my Alan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan smiled. He had come across as strange proofs
of telepathy as in the old world between kindred spirits.
Whatever happened he knew Waz-Y-Kjesta was his
friend. “Perhaps I am in danger, my friend,” said
he. “If so can I count on you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Alan, I would suffer even serquor for you,”
he answered fervently. And Alan knew he spoke
truly.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE UNFORGIVEABLE KISS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The day passed slowly. Still the Princess remained
in her cabin. Alan passed Waiko with his usual
cheery smile, and the guilty student trembled and
turned white at sight of the healthy man, who he
thought had been doomed to serquor. Kulmervan
remained in his cabin near the princess, and had his
meals served him there. Waz-Y-Kjesta realized that
something was wrong, but as Alan did not confide in
him, he made no effort to find out the cause of his
friend’s restlessness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Waz,” said Alan suddenly, “is it possible for
me to see the Ipso-Rorka? I wish to speak to her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not unless she sends for you, my friend. It is
impossible else.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a matter of grave import,” said Alan
earnestly. “To me, to her—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing can alter custom, my friend. If she
sends for you—well. Otherwise—” and he shrugged
his shoulders expressively. Alan, however, was
determined to speak with Chlorie by foul means or
fair. Her cabin was situated in the front of the ship,
and round it was a tiny balcony railed in just above the
level of the deck.</p>

<p class='c012'>He paced round this portion of the ship the whole
day, resting only at mealtimes from his self imposed
watch. Never once did the Princess appear. The
Kymo was setting, the sky was bright with sunset
colours; the sea was unruffled and calm. A fish leapt
out of the water leaving rings of glistening fluid,
roseate in the glow. Alan sat, out of sight, still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>watching the cabin door. Suddenly it opened and
Morar, the Princess’ personal attendant appeared.
She looked around hastily. “All is quiet, my
Princess,” she cried. “No one is in sight. The
sinful stranger is in his cabin, no doubt plotting ill
against you and yours.” Chlorie came through the
doorway. Her hair was gleaming, and her flowing
draperies of blue showed up the fairness of her skin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am stifled, Morar. ’Tis ill to spend so many
hours without a breath of air. Watch you the other
side, and should you see the evil one appear, appraise
me, and I will again take shelter within.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With a low bow Morar vanished, closing the cabin
door behind her. The Princess paced up and down
the tiny balcony, singing a Keemarnian lullaby. Still
Alan remained silent and watchful, hidden from sight
beneath the covering rail. Morar returned. “There
is no sign of Alan the evil one,” said she, “but
Taz-Ak Kulmervan begs an audience.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Bid him come hither,” said the Princess with a
sigh. “Tell him I am weary, and must beg of him to
be quick about his business.” She seated herself on a
swinging lounge, just above Alan, who could almost
feel the sweetness of her presence, the fragrance of
her breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sweet Cousin,” said Kulmervan entering.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Kulmervan, say what you have to say
quickly. My head is tired—my eyes weary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have not been out to-day, my Chlorie?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not until this evening. I have carefully obeyed
your instructions. Were my father here, I should not
care. But I dare not run any risks in his absence.
How is Waiko?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Still very weak, my Princess. This evil one, this
Alan, had contrived his evil work well. When I discovered
Waiko a bandage was drawn tightly round his
mouth, his nostrils were plugged with wool, and had I
not entered when I did, serquor would have set in and
Waiko would no more have laughed and played.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it’s terrible,” breathed the Princess. “Why
has sin thus entered our beautiful land? I have heard
of treasons, and plots and miseries; but so far we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>have escaped. What is this stranger’s object, my
Kulmervan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not all his treachery, my Chlorie, but—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why bring sorrow on Waiko’s family, and upon
you, his friend?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not understand, but his intentions are evil
throughout. I heard him tell his kinsman Desmond,
that even the person of Chlorie herself was not sacred
to him, provided he worked his will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is enough, Kulmervan,” she interrupted
haughtily. “I will keep my cabin as you advise.
Had I known in time, I should not have travelled home
in his company. The Rorka, my father, will deal
with this stranger, and the Hall of Sorrows will hold
him safely, until he has been purged clean. Now
good night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Chlorie,” said Kulmervan passionately. “I dare
say much to you to-night. Will you not offer me the
flower of love? I dare not ask you to wed me—you
are Ipso-Rorka—’tis for you to choose. But know I
love you, love you with all my soul. Will you not
honour me by choosing me for your mate?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Kulmervan,” said the Princess gently. “Why
make me sad by all this useless talk? It can never be.
I can place my hand in only one man’s—him I love.
Him, alas, I have not yet met, but I do not love you,
my Kulmervan. I never shall. Think, we played
together in Hoormoori as babes, built palaces of sand
by the sea, picked flowers and fondled our pets. We
grew as brother and sister until you went to study
with the Djoh, and I had to learn the lesson of
royalty. No, my kinsman. I love you ’tis true, but
not as a maid should love the man she mates, not as
wife for husband, lover for lover. Let this be the last
time you speak of such things, my Kulmervan. I
will forget, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I want you—you—you—,” and Kulmervan
strode close to her and placed his arms about her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me go,” breathed the girl—but his lips were
seeking hers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No—no—no,” she cried. “Not my lips—Kulmervan
be merciful. My lips are sacred until I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>wed—spare my lips.” But Kulmervan’s reason had
gone. “My beautiful one,” he murmured, and ran
his fingers through her glorious mantle of hair. He
held her head between his hands, and drank in the
glory of her face. Her eyes were open wide in terror,
her lips tightly compressed, her power of movement
gone. Nearer, nearer he drew. His breath came in
hot gusts upon her cheek. Her eyelids quivered under
his scorching kisses. Her cheeks reddened as his
lips touched them. With one mighty effort she tried
to release herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the name of Mitzor the Great, leave my lips,”
she cried, but the madness of passion was upon him.
He revelled in his power, laughed at her struggles,
mocked at her impotence. Roughly he clasped her
still closer to him, but the Princess was inert in his
arms—the strain was too much for her, and blissful
unconsciousness had come to soothe her. There was
the slightest of sounds. Alan, the athletic still, vaulted
over the rail, and swinging Kulmervan by the scruff of
his neck threw him on to the ground. Tenderly he
lifted the Princess in his arms—she was as light as a
feather—and went into her cabin.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Morar,” he called. “Morar.” The serving maid
appeared, trembling as she saw her beloved mistress
in the arms of “the evil one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your mistress has had a fright,” said Alan
thickly. “Show me her couch.” Without a word
the little maid led the way into the tiny sleeping
apartment, and tenderly he laid his burden on the
silken coverings of blue. “Look after her,” said
he, “she has fainted.” With arms folded across his
chest and his breath coming in spasmodic jerks, he
waited outside the door. Presently Morar appeared.
“The Ipso-Rorka has recovered,” she said, “and has
now fallen asleep. What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Allow no one to enter her apartments at all. I
will send a letter to her in the morning. Can I depend
on your giving it to her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. I can see you are not evil,” said the little
maid. “Some mistake has been made. You are
her friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“I am her friend,” said Alan grimly. “Remember,
Morar, no one is to enter these apartments without
the Ipso-Rorka’s permission. You understand?”
and he strode out on to the balcony. Kulmervan had
gone, and he vaulted lightly over the balcony rail and
went straight to his cabin. As he opened the door
he recognized the sweet, sickly odour that he had
smelt once before. So! He must be on his guard.
Kulmervan and Waiko would stop at nothing—a
madness had indeed come over them, a madness of
the earth!</p>

<p class='c012'>Holding his breath he went swiftly across the
room, and opened the windows, then shutting the
door behind him, went into the big saloon. Waz-Y-Kjesta
smiled as he entered. “Where have you
been, my friend? I looked for you everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Resting,” said Alan grimly. That night he never
went to bed, but waited grimly for what might
happen. He was left in peace, however, and toward
dawn slept fitfully. When he woke, he wrote this
letter to Chlorie.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c019'>

me—I will obey.</p>

<p class='c012'>He took the letter to Morar himself. “I will wait
while the Ipso-Rorka reads it,” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a moment she had returned. “She will answer
you later.” There were only four more nights to be
spent on board the Chlorie, but much might happen
in that time. There was no sign of the enemy—all
Alan could do was to wait patiently for their next
move.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night, again, he had no sleep. Soon after he
retired, the same sickly odour permeated the cabin.
Again he leant out of the window until the fumes
had passed; this time they were stronger and took a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>longer time to dispel. He smiled—it was to be a
duel to the end, and he needed all his wits about him.
Certainly, Keemarnians possessed of the “madness”
were more formidable, more crafty, more callous
enemies, than men belonging to Terra. Another night
passed—no communication had come from Chlorie.
Alan, weary of his vigil, tried to keep awake, but
drowsiness overcame him, and his last conscious effort
was to drag himself to the window, and rest with his
head breathing in the pure air. Again the sweet fumes
entered the room, but Alan had safeguarded himself.
The next night passed without the enemy showing
their hand. They doubtless thought him proof
against “serquor” and would take other methods
to rid themselves of his presence. Suddenly in the
darkness of the night, a noise interrupted his musings.
There was a jerk—a crash—and the vessel shivered.
Alan flew out of his cabin and met Waz-Y-Kjesta.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing to be alarmed about, my friend. Something
has happened to the engine. I have not
discovered what, yet—we shall be forced to make a
descent. Luckily there is an island near; we will
anchor there, and put the matter right. We shall
be delayed only a very short time, I think.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The machine descended in jerks and jumps with
many creakings and groanings, but reached the
ground in safety.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will seek Morar, and tell her to acquaint the
Ipso-Rorka with this news,” said the Waz. The
whole day passed, and the Y-Kjesta called Alan in
dismay. “I cannot understand it,” said he. “There
is a screw missing here, and that waste pipe has been
filled with refuse. It means taking the whole of the
mechanism to pieces, and two days delay at least.”
But Alan guessed who had planned this sinister work,
and that night he kept vigil—not in his own room,
but outside the Princess’.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta was frankly puzzled. “Yesterday
I fixed up the screw for the outer valve,” said he,
“yet to-day it has gone again. Surely I couldn’t
have dreamt it—yet it could not go without hands.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“Perhaps some one has moved it, purposely, for
spite,” suggested Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Y-Kjesta laughed. “Not in Keemar. Besides
what for? Who could do such a foolish thing?”</p>

<p class='c012'>True, the faith of a Keemarnian was wonderful.
Alan longed to confide in him—yet dared not. For
the second time he made a mistake. Alan saw Morar
and asked her if the Princess’ apartments were quite
safe from intruders.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite,” said she. “There is only a very small
window, and the doors have heavy bars.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She always keeps them locked?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Always.”</p>

<p class='c012'>That night Alan remained in his own cabin, and
worn out with continual watching, fell asleep at his
open window. He had a dream so vivid that he
thought it was real, and awoke with a start. Chlorie—the
lady of his heart had appeared to him, arms
outstretched, eyes swimming with tears—“My
Lord,” she whispered. “The Cave of Whispering
Madness—the Cave—” Her voice trailed away,
something dark came before his eyes, there was the
sound of a scuffle, a small cry, he felt a stabbing pain,
and he awoke. It was broad daylight, and his door
was flung open wide and Waz-Y-Kjesta, usually so
placid and calm, was staring at him and calling him
in excited distress.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Alan! Awake! I beg of you—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Ipso-Rorka—is gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gone?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Gone! She has disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Morar, her maid, left her as usual last night.
This morning she knocked as usual for the Princess
to open the door, which by the way, she always keeps
barred, but she could get no answer. Thinking her
mistress had overslept she went round to look in at
the window. The bed was empty—Chlorie was not
there”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where is Kulmervan?” asked Alan thickly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Kulmervan?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“Yes. Is he on the boat?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not know”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go and see at once, and I’ll go to Morar”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Ipso-Rorka’s little maid was crying bitterly.
Without any ceremony Alan forced the door. The
bed was rumpled and rough; the silken coverlets
twisted and torn—Chlorie had not gone without
a struggle!</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta came to Alan, with consternation
written all over his face. “Three are missing
altogether” said he “Can some evil spirit have
taken them? Kulmervan and Waiko are nowhere to
be found”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought as much” said Alan savagely. He
glanced rapidly round the room. A pile of papers lay
on a desk. He smoothed them out. There, in a
little blue envelope addressed to himself, was a letter
from his dear one. He opened it quickly.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>My Lord</i>, (it ran)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Since you saved me from my kinsman, Kulmervan my

is possessed of a madness. I beg of you save me from him.

<p class='c012'>Then underneath was written,</p>

<p class='c015'>“He has spoken to me again through my window. He
threatens me with dishonour—disgrace. He talks of the
Cave of Whispering Madness. Come to me on receipt of
this”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The cur” muttered Alan. He turned to
Y-Kjesta. “Where is the Cave of Whispering-Madness?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have never heard of it, my Alan”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen. I am going to find Chlorie. Wait for
me here with the air bird. Should I fail to come by
the time the Kymo has sunk ten times—go at once to
the Rorka, and ask him to send his aid here”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where then, is Chlorie?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“I don’t know, but I’m going to do my best to
find out. This island isn’t very big—ten miles square
at the most, and I intend to search every bit of it if
necessary, to find her”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What about Kulmervan and Waiko?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Should you see them, put them under restraint.
Bar their windows, and prevent their escape. They
are both possessed of the madness—but there, I doubt
if you’ll see them. Where Chlorie is—there shall I
also find Kulmervan and Waiko”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can I come too?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my friend. You stay here and watch in case
Chlorie comes. I go now—I shall take no provision
with me—fruit will be my meat, and the sap of the
water tree my drink. Farewell” and Alan leapt over
the bulwarks and disappeared from sight in the thick
brush and undergrowth of the island.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>ALAN—THE KNIGHT ERRANT</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As Alan leapt over the bulwarks, his quick eye caught
sight of footmarks, two going one way, and two the
other, with perhaps five feet between them. “So,”
said he grimly to himself, “they were carrying her
between them. Poor little Chlorie.” The tracks were
easy to follow, they led down to the sea and along the
seashore. Steadily they went on and Alan followed
dauntlessly. There was no attempt made to cover their
traces. On they went, carrying their burden between
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>They had about ten hours start, and although night
was falling, Alan continued at his self imposed task.
Darker and darker it grew, until at length it was
impossible to see the footmarks, so he sat down
hopelessly to wait for the dawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>The night was chilly and the rain poured down, so
Alan was soaked to the skin, and shivered violently
as the grey dawn rose. The rain had almost obliterated
the marks, but they showed up faintly here and
there on the wet sand. He had no time to look at
the scenery through which he was passing—his one
thought was Chlorie—not the Princess, but Chlorie
the woman, Chlorie his love.</p>

<p class='c012'>On, on he went all day, and still the footprints showed
here and there. Night came, and again he was forced
to rest and wait for the light. He was colder than
ever, he shivered violently, and longed for the warmth
of the sun. That night he never slept at all, and he
rose in the early morning light stiff and tired. His
head felt light, his limbs ached, and the one thing he
could think of coherently was Chlorie.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Suddenly all traces of the marks vanished. He
hunted high and low, but all to no purpose; they
ended as abruptly as if the pursued had been snatched
up into the heavens.</p>

<p class='c012'>Two nights and two days he wandered to and fro.
He was chilled to the bone, and was in a high fever.
At last he had to give in, and lay under the shelter
of a tree. The warmth of the sun revived him, and
he crawled weakly to a bush on which grew luscious
plums, ate his fill and slept. When he awoke he felt
better and stronger. Perhaps he had been dreaming—the
footprints <i>must</i> go on. But no, they came to
an end at a grassy edge, and there was no mark to
show that human beings had passed that way. He
spent that day hunting for a sign of the fugitives, but
was unsuccessful, and wearily retraced his way to the
air bird.</p>

<p class='c012'>The scenery was beautiful. The island rose to a
chain of peaks in the centre, and beautiful passes and
wooded valleys led through the mountains to the
further side. The vegetation was purely tropical.
Palms, breast high, grew to the edge of the sea shore;
the undergrowth showed no sign of any animal
inhabitants; not a twig was broken, not a leaf trampled
upon, to mark the passage of a foreign body. Alan
made the return journey quickly, and soon found
himself at the edge of the bush. But the “Chlorie”
had gone! There were the signs of where she had
rested; the mark on the sand of her wheels; an oily
patch on the ground showing where her engines had
been lubricated—but all sign of her had vanished.
Had Waz-Y-Kjesta failed him, or had Chlorie
returned? He felt in his pockets—there was a scrap
of paper and a pencil. “I am going inland,” he
wrote. “If you come back, search for me. Alan.”
He pegged it to the ground close to where the
Chlorie had been anchored, and turning his face
westwards, retraced his footsteps.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time passed without his reckoning. When the
nights came he lived for the day; and in the day time
he dreaded the coming of the night. He reached the
place where the footsteps ceased at dusk, and for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>first time for days, slept through the night peacefully.
His fever had abated, but he still felt curiously weak.
Yet his brain was clear, and he set to work again to
hunt carefully for the missing ones. Yard by yard
he worked, and at last his patience was rewarded.
There, on a bush low on the ground, he saw a piece
of something blue that fluttered on the breeze. He
stooped and picked it off the twig—it was blue silk,
and with a thrill he recognized it as a piece of
Chlorie’s dress. Feverishly he looked round him;
alas, there was no other piece to act as a further
guide. A thought came to him, and he lay flat on
the ground and peered under the bush. There, a
grassy avenue unfolded itself before his wondering
gaze—it had been completely hidden by the dense
woody undergrowth. So it was under this bush they
had made their escape, and it was probably in
dragging the unconscious girl through, that her dress
was torn.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan wormed his way under the bushes, and gasped
in wonder at the vista opened out before him. A
straight avenue—bordered on either side by thick
bushes and overhanging trees, ran perhaps two miles
in a straight line. The grass underfoot was soft and
velvety, and a narrow streamlet ran over white stones
at one side. The bushes were laden with fruit, but
even a cursory glance showed that a quantity had
been picked quite recently. Twigs bearing fruit had
been roughly broken off, and trampled under foot.
On went Alan until he reached the end of the avenue,
where four paths branched out in four different
directions. He hesitated for a second—all four
looked like virgin ground. But his eyes were
quickened by love, and only love could have noticed
a small patch of damp earth close to the water’s edge
from where a stone had been kicked aside in a hasty
transit. He looked round and saw the stone, its
under side still damp—and knew that the fugitives
were not too far off.</p>

<p class='c012'>Down the path he went which twisted and turned,
now narrow now wide again. Suddenly the path also
came to an end, and thick bushes and low growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>vegetation barred his way. Profiting by his past
experience, he tried to peer under the bushes, but
could find no sign of an outlet anywhere. All at once
there came the sound of voices so close that he turned
quickly, expecting to see figures behind him. But
there was no one in sight. He listened intently—the
voices came again—the Keemarnian tongue which he
could understand quite well by this time— “—will
leave you here,” “—spare me, I beg”—“leave you
here”—“Kulmervan have mercy—mercy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was all very disjointed, and the sounds seemed
to come from every direction. Again he heard his
loved one’s voice—distorted it is true, but even in the
hoarse tones, he recognized that it was Chlorie speaking.
“—get away.—help me. Waiko help—my
father will reward—Waiko—” The voice trailed off.
Alan was frankly puzzled. The voice came first
behind, then before him—then it seemed to come
from Heaven itself. A hoarse laugh sounded—Kulmervan’s.
Alan was on the near track at last.
Again the maniacal laugh came, fading away in the
distance. Alan realized the trick nature had played
him. He was listening not to the tones of his loved
one, or her abductor, but to an echo. The originals
might still be many miles away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Madly he tried to force his way through the undergrowth.
It was impossible. All night long he stayed
in the little cul-de-sac, and at intervals caught
fragments of conversation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“prevent her escaping.—torture her if need be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“—love me Chlorie, just love me,” “—save me,
Waiko!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“—keep you with me always.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The madness indeed possessed Kulmervan and his
friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the sun rose Alan made one more attempt
to leave the enclosure. Crawling on his belly, he
wormed his way round the roots of the bushes. At
last he discovered an opening. He crept through it,
low upon the ground. When he got through, a
network of pathways confronted him, but it was
quite easy to discover the pathway Kulmervan had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>taken. Feeling secure in his flight, he now refrained
from attempting to cover his tracks. By the broken
grass and branches, the general upheaval of the soil,
Alan was convinced that through this part of their
retreat, they had dragged their unwilling victim along
the path, so he ground his teeth and swore softly
under his breath.</p>

<p class='c012'>Twisting and turning the path opened out into a
valley—a valley of rocks and stones between two
mighty mountains. The scene was desolate, awe
inspiring, dreary—almost terrifying in its grandeur.
For perhaps two miles he followed it, until again it
narrowed and the character of the scene changed.
Once more it was a leafy lane he was traversing, that
might have been in Devonshire, with its red earth
and dainty ferns.</p>

<p class='c012'>At intervals during the day he heard the echo, and
it led him on—on—to his love.</p>

<p class='c012'>A sound came upon his ear; it was that of voices—real
voices, this time—no longer an echo. Cautiously
he crept from tree to tree. There in the centre of a
clearing sat Kulmervan. His robe was torn, his skin
scratched—his eyes held a look of madness. At his
feet stretched Waiko, listening eagerly to his friend’s
counsel. And tied to a tree, her fair hair covering
her, her garments lying strewn on the ground beside
her, torn from her body by her half mad kinsman,
Kulmervan—was Chlorie. Her head was sunk on
her breast. She was breathing heavily.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan dared not move—it was two against one, and
he had to save himself for her. Silent as a sleuth
hound, he watched and waited; and even as he did
so Chlorie lifted her head and gazed across the bodies
of the two Keemarnians. Through the leafy spaces
their eyes met. Into hers came recognition, followed
by a flush of shame, as she shook her hair closer still
about her gleaming body. Then she smiled a
trustful smile, and dropped her head once more upon
her breast.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>THE CAVE OF WHISPERING MADNESS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Throughout the night Alan watched. Never did
Kulmervan move from his place in the clearing—never
did his eyes close nor did he show the slightest inclination
to sleep. Towards morning Waiko raised himself
from the ground. He was pitiable to look upon. Led
on by a stronger will the madness had come upon him
also. But it was a weaker madness than that which
affected Kulmervan—it was a madness that chattered
and gibbered in the sun, that laughed and cackled
insanely—a madness that was pitiful to behold.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan watched through the leafy branches, and as the
dawn rose, many times he met Chlorie’s questioning
gaze with looks of encouragement and help. And
she knew that when the time was ripe, this strange
Lord from another world would save and deliver her.</p>

<p class='c012'>As Kulmervan still made no attempt to move, Alan
wondered whether it would be possible to overpower
him. He made a movement and the slight sound was
heard. Kulmervan sprang to his feet and looked
round, and Alan saw he was clutching the huge limb
of a tree—a formidable weapon in a madman’s hands.
He was evidently not satisfied, and peered round the
tree trunks carefully. Quietly Alan crept behind a
large bush, and dropping on his belly he wormed himself
underneath it until he was completely hidden.</p>

<p class='c012'>The crackling of a twig was heard by the madman,
who, with his dormant passions aroused was a
dangerous enemy. He spoke sharply to Waiko.
“What sound is that, my Waiko? Is it the stranger
that tracketh us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not,” said Waiko shuddering. “Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Kulmervan, my friend, let us leave the Ipso-Rorka
here, and flee from the wrath of her father.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nonsense, my Waiko! When the Rorka is told
that his daughter, Chlorie the Fair, Chlorie the Pure,
has spent forty and one nights with us in the darkness,
he will be glad to give his soiled goods into my keeping
for ever. Then in good time, I shall become Rorka.
Shall I not punish my Chlorie then, for her indifference
and insults?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waiko shuddered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Chlorie,” cried Kulmervan suddenly, his
manner changing. “Will you not promise me your
hand? Oh, my darling, forgive me—I love you so—I
love you. Give me your hand—swear before Waiko
that you’ll take me for your mate. I’ll be so good to
you—I’ll love you so” His voice was pleading. His
earnestness could not be doubted, yet Alan knew it
was but a moment’s lull in the disordered brain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chlorie never answered a word, and her silence
drove Kulmervan again to threats. Tearing a handful
of withes from the side of a running brook, he lashed
the captive Princess across her legs with the stinging
rushes. With an oath Alan burst from his hiding place,
and was on the back of his enemy, before Kulmervan
could recover from his astonishment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then followed a terrific fight. Alan with all his
knowledge of the scientific sport was unable to get
in a knockout blow. He parried and thrust, and
landed Kulmervan a heavy blow under his jaw. His
opponent tottered for a moment, but the blow had
no lasting effect, and the heavy Keemarnian struck
mightier blows still at his enemy. Waiko was entirely
demoralized. He stood watching the fight—his breath
coming in gasps, his blue eyes staring, his teeth
chattering. As an ally, he was useless to Kulmervan;
as an enemy he counted as naught to Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chlorie, tied tightly to the tree, was unable to move.
Her wide open eyes followed the fighters in an agony
of spirit; but not a sound came from her lips. True
to the tradition of her land, the daughter of the Rorka
gave no audible sign of her terror. Alan knew he
was weakening. Imperceptibly at first he lost ground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>but gradually he realized that his blows had no effect
upon the Keemarnian. His hasty rush into the field of
battle was worse than useless—he could no longer help
his love. The Keemarnian gave him one terrific blow
in the stomach. His wind went—he gasped, choked
for breath, crumpled up and sank to the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan left his vanquished enemy’s side and
went to Waiko who had been stupidly watching the
scene.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Watch him,” he commanded. “If he show any
sign of awakening, give him a blow with this. It will
be sufficient to put him to sleep again,” and he tossed
the heavy stick beside the prostrate body.</p>

<p class='c012'>Brutally he untied the ropes that bound Chlorie.
She was stiff and weak, and the agony as the blood once
more coursed freely through her veins, was almost more
than she could bear. Still she remained silent, and
with a noble gesture of majesty, stooped, and drew
her mantle of blue about her naked body. Two other
garments still lay on the ground—with a sudden
thought she caught one up, and drew it within the
folds of her cloak. She had a plan! Love had been
born to her, in that exquisite moment of agony when
she saw Alan knocked down. Her soul cried out
within her that here was her mate at last. Her fine
sense of belief and trust told her that it was impossible
that he was sleeping the sleep of serquor. Sometime
he would rise again—bruised, bleeding, torn,
perhaps, but rise he would, and come to her aid.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan took her roughly by the arm. “Come,”
said he. “Waiko wait until the Kymo is full in the
Heavens—it is but a short time. If Alan the Evil has
not moved by then, follow me quickly. Always to the
East, my friend. Always take the most easterly path,
and you will find me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are you going?” asked Waiko in horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the Cave of Whispering Madness,” said he,
and involuntarily Chlorie shuddered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know where it is, my Kulmervan?” asked
Waiko.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. Have I not been there often? Ah, my
friend, I arranged that the engines should fail. Ah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>oft times should I have been in the Hall of Sorrows,
but I came here instead, and of my own free will. I
know the place I intend taking you to—I will show you
sights—sights I have seen—ha! ha! ha!” and with
a wild burst of laughter he dragged his unwilling
captive through the bushes, and made his way
Eastward.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waiko remained silent, watching his vanishing friend.
His mind was working strangely. The madness had
left a deep sense of fear in the heart of Waiko. The
inanimate body of Alan seemed to point to his undoing.
The blood trickled slowly down the unconscious man’s
face till there was a little red pool shining wickedly
on the green grass. With a cry, Waiko picked up the
club and swung it once, twice round his head. But as
he would have swung it a third time, it slipped out of
his nerveless fingers, and went spinning a hundred
feet away. With a cry at his loneliness, Waiko turned
and fled after Kulmervan. In a short space of time
he had caught them up, and noticed with surprise that
Chlorie was walking almost willingly with her captor.
There was a rope passed round her body, it was true,
but it was slack in the centre, and although she
lagged somewhat behind, there was no need to drag
her along.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alan?” questioned Kulmervan, as Waiko reached
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is serquor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I struck him, as he rose to hurt me. With one
mighty blow I felled him to the ground. The heavy
weapon you left with me I dashed on his head.— Now
he lies quiet, and cold and bloody.” Waiko almost
believed his story, and as he recounted it, he looked
upon himself as a hero.</p>

<p class='c012'>“’Tis well, my Waiko,” said Kulmervan. “What
say you to that, my Chlorie? Alan is serquor—never
more will Kymo rise upon his smiling face. Never
more will he force his presence upon the people of
Keemar. He is gone for ever from our sight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Chlorie made no reply—only from beneath her
mantle could be seen a slight convulsive movement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>and from underneath came a tiny tatter of blue, that
caught on a rose bush and fluttered in the breeze.</p>

<p class='c012'>Birds singing—sweetly smelling flowers—a sense of
hunger and thirst. These were the first conscious
thoughts Alan had, as he opened his eyes on the world
once more. He rose from the ground. His head was
sore, but the bleeding had ceased. He plucked some
luscious fruit that grew low to the ground. It revived
him. Then he tried to think. Chlorie had been taken
from him once more—but he would find her yet. He
tenderly touched the tree to which she had been bound—and
stooped and picked up the silken garment she
had left behind. It was just a piece of soft, blue
drapery that crumpled into nothingness in his hand.
He kissed it reverently—it was part of his love.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked round wearily—there, attached to a bush
was a piece of something blue—he bent over it—it was
part of her gown. Further down, in the very centre
of the path was another piece, while in the distance
he could see yet a third. It was a sign. Chlorie was
directing him the way she had gone. The trail was
difficult to follow. The breeze had blown many
pieces away altogether—others it had carried away
playfully into a wrong direction, but by careful
watchfulness, he discovered the right way, and there
were always the little pieces of blue to guide him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he lost the trail altogether. The last piece of
blue was caught on a stone at the bottom of a mighty
face of rock. No matter where he looked, there was
no shred of blue to cheer him. He ran his hand over
the surface of the rock, it was of a reddish sandstone
and quite smooth. All around was a low-lying
valley with neither a stone nor a tree behind which any
one could hide. He could see for about ten miles, and
there was no sign of the fugitives. Backward and
forward he walked by the mighty wall of rock, and
always his journey ended by the last little flutter of
blue. The cliff rose sheer perhaps three hundred feet,
and the solid wall extended as far as eye could reach.
It was unthinkable that Kulmervan had scaled the
wall—yet whither had he gone?</p>

<p class='c012'>Suddenly he heard a rumbling noise; the sound of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>a thousand people whispering, and in front of him a
huge slab of rock swung back, revealing a cavity
within. The whispering grew louder and louder.
He looked round for a hiding place. There was none—so
without a moment’s hesitation he leapt inside the
darkened cavern. A narrow path led downwards, and
it was up this path the whispering seemed to be
coming; whispering that sounded like a veritable army
speaking in hushed tones. There was a piece of rock
jutting out—Alan slipped into its embracing shadows,
and waited. The sounds came nearer and nearer—then
Kulmervan appeared with Waiko at his side.
“The voices whispered that a stranger was coming.
The voices are never wrong. See, my Waiko, see
yonder if Alan the Evil is approaching.” The voice
whispered and rolled in the darkness. The whole
place was unwholesome and terrifying.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan followed Waiko into the sunlight.
Immediately they were out of sight, Alan slipped from
his hiding place and ran swiftly down the narrow
passageway. The faster he ran, the faster he drew
in his breath, and it seemed as if a thousand men were
mocking him. He sighed as his breath caught in his
throat—immediately there were a thousand sighs
behind him. Quicker, quicker he tore down the
passage, to where he hoped, somewhere he would find
his love hidden. The path was steep and narrow and
was in total darkness, and he risked his life in his mad
rush through the whispering horrors. He heard the
voices again! Kulmervan and Waiko had returned.
Blindly he rushed on—stumbling here, tripping there,
in his haste to reach the Ipso-Rorka.</p>

<p class='c012'>The path took an upward turn—he tripped over
something. Putting his hands out before him, he felt
on the ground. Rough steps had been cut out of the
rock. Steadily he mounted upwards—upwards—the
darkness was intense—the whispering shadows terrifying;
but he never ceased his mad pace, so eager was
he to reach Chlorie.</p>

<p class='c012'>Steadily he ascended the stairs—they seemed interminable.
Then in the distance, he saw a yellowish
spot of light. As he rose higher, it became bigger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>until it ended in a blaze of brightness. He had
reached the top and was in an enormous cavern lit
by torches in sockets all round the walls. The awful
grandeur of the place startled him. In the very
centre was a huge figure, twenty feet high. It was
seated on a throne and had its hands outspread as if
in benediction. It possessed a terrible face, cruel,
hard, sensual,—and the incongruity of the posing of
the hands struck Alan at once. Round the cave, at
equal distances, were other figures, all enormous in
stature, and possessing in their features the same
bestial cruelty and lust. Stalactites hung from the
roof. Stalactites forty feet long—Stalactites fifty feet
long. Stalactites glorious, yet like deadly serpents
with heads outstretched ready to strike. In one corner
of the place was a huge beast in stone. Once it had
lived, no doubt, now it was fossilized and cold. It
was similar to the ichthyosaurus of prehistoric days—an
evil-looking beast in its life, but infinitely more
terrible in its stone period.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every movement Alan made was intensified a
thousand times in this Cave of Whispering Madness.
He realized what the name meant. It could indeed,
drive the sanest man mad. He realized that he had a
fair start of the two Keemarnians, and hurriedly hunted
for his lost love. Softly he called, but although her
name reverberated from floor to roof, no answering
cry took up his challenge. Then whispering voices
sounded nearer. Silently he slipped behind the stone
monster that had once lived and mated. He was only
just in time. Still louder grew the whisperings, and
Kulmervan and Waiko appeared at the top of the stairway.
With the greatest difficulty Alan was able
to distinguish their words. The whisperings were so
loud, so sibilant, that the voices sounded like one long
hiss.</p>

<p class='c012'>The two Keemarnians came close to the big carved
figure in the centre of the cave. Kulmervan bent low
on both knees before the hideous figure. “Spirit of
our Fathers,” he cried out. “Humbly I pray, take my
soul into thy keeping. It is thine—thine for ever—but
in return, I pray you, grant me Chlorie’s love. See,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>I sprinkle thee with my blood in ratification of my
bond,” and with a short knife he severed a vein in
his arm and sprinkled the statue with the warm, red
fluid.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waiko was whispering, “Mitzor the Mighty, have
mercy! Have mercy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fool,” cried Kulmervan. “Why mention that
name here? I have bargained with Pirox the Killer—I
belong to him. Chlorie shall be mine. You have
come thus far with me, my Waiko, but further thou
shalt go. Down, down on thy knees before Pirox—admit
that he is great—greater than Mitzor! Ask a
favour—nay demand a favour—seal it with thy blood.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Waiko went down on his knees. His face was ashen—he
was trembling in every limb. Then came a
strange duet, intensified a thousand times by the
whisperings. “Mitzor the Mighty.” “Pirox the
Killer.” “Pirox.” “Mitzor.” “Mitzor.” “Pirox.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In a passion Kulmervan arose, and struck Waiko,
down. “Lie there, thou dog,” he cried. “May thou
sleep for ever in serquor. I alone am mighty. Pirox
alone is great.” Waiko never moved, he showed no
signs of breathing. Had he indeed fallen into the
trance-like state that the inhabitants of Keemar so
dreaded? It seemed hopeless to Alan, that he would
ever find Chlorie in this cavern of horror. He
realized at last that Kulmervan was a degenerate.
The entrance of poor Murdoch had not caused the
madness. No doubt he had posed as a good
Keemarnian, but he suffered from the madness, and
deep in his heart even denied the existence of Mitzor
the Mighty, the Great White Glory, and indulged in
devil worship and fetish honour. What this Cave of
Whispering Madness was Alan could not conjecture—perhaps
in some far gone age, fallen Jovians had met
here; made the Temple for their abominable worship,
and lived a second life, unsuspected by their friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>That the image in the centre was their god, Alan was
convinced. But how had Kulmervan discovered it?
Had it been handed down to him from his childhood,
or had he in some way found it for himself? If was
pitiful to see—a young Keemarnian of noble lineage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>saturated with heathen mythology and heretical
dogma. In truth he was a menace to his companions,
living a life of deceit and sin. His was a complex
character, for there was much that was sweet and
lovable about him, and he was much to be pitied, for
when his secret was discovered he would indeed
become a pariah and an outcast. At the moment
he felt he was safe, and continued his “Black
Sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For Chlorie’s sake, Alan was forced to witness in
silence the horrors that followed. At the foot of the
statue was a slab of stone—raised perhaps ten inches
from the ground. Upon it were ominous red stains.
Quickly Kulmervan set about his business. In one
corner of the cave were piles of brushwood—these
he piled high under the stone slab. With a mighty
effort he lifted the senseless Waiko upon it, and rested
his head in a tiny curve at one end. Alan shuddered
to see how it fitted the neck. The use of the slab was
plain to see. He set fire to the wood by one of the
torches, and the smoke curled up and the wood hissed
and sizzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the fire was safely alight, Kulmervan went to
a corner of the cavern, and touched a hidden spring.
A door opened, and revealed a flight of steps inside,
leading below. As soon as he was out of sight, Alan
rushed from his hiding place, lifted Waiko from the
altar and hid him behind the mammoth fossil.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the noise of his movements was magnified a
thousandfold by the hideous whispering echoes of the
place. Waiko was still and quiet—he scarcely breathed,
and Alan dared not try to revive him. Kulmervan
returned bearing in his arms a precious burden in
blue. Alan started, and leant forward; his darling was
not unconscious, but was submitting to the indignity
put upon her with her usual patience. At the altar
he stopped in frozen amazement. The stone was
beginning to show red,—the deadly fire should have
begun its work—but the altar was empty. He
looked round—there was no one in sight. With a
cry of rage he let go the rope to which Chlorie was
fastened, put her to the ground, and darted to the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>of the stairway leading to the cave’s entrance. And
the yells of his curses and imprecations rose on the
air, in volumes of sinister whisperings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was but six feet from his dear one. With a
mighty rush he leapt from his hiding place, and caught
Chlorie in his arms. He made for the secret door
through which Kulmervan had brought her; Kulmervan
heard the sounds and was just in time to see two
figures disappearing through the little door. With
another oath he strode across the cave—but the figures
had a big start. They had closed the door behind
them, and his fingers hesitated over the secret lock;
so he was delayed by his own impatience and anger.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chlorie had given herself up for lost, and when she
felt two strong arms encircle her a vague terror came
over her, but even as she was lifted up, a voice
whispered in her ear—“Have no fear. ’Tis I—Alan.
Trust yourself to me and I will save you.”
Her emotion was too great for her to speak, but she
let herself nestle in comfort in the arms of the powerful
stranger.</p>

<p class='c012'>The door clanged behind them—more stairs, very
narrow. Down Alan went, and the darkness gave
place to a faint light.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know—but there is a cave down here which
is kept padlocked—it was there I was imprisoned.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan looked round quickly; the passage had widened
and openings led off on either side. Immediately in
front of them seemed to come the daylight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can you run?” he asked tenderly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—yes. Oh, to be free of Kulmervan!”
Through the dim light they went. The whisperings
were not quite as bad as in the upper cave, but still
they were quite fearsome enough. They seemed to
people the place with dead men—men who laughed,
and jeered, and pointed their clammy fingers at their
victims. But upon the whisperings came a more
fearful sound—Kulmervan’s laughter!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry—hurry, my Princess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot,” she breathed. “My heart beats—it
hurts me to talk.” Without a word he picked the light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>burden again up in his arms and made off at a still
greater pace; she flung one arm round his neck and
clung to him confidingly. Nearer came the laughter.
It was so close that it seemed almost on the top of them.
Alan never forgot that journey; with his precious
burden in his arms he hurried onward, always following
the light. And nearer and nearer came the footsteps
of the madman. At last they turned a corner—the
cave opened out and they saw Kymo, shining in
all his glory; the sea was breaking gently on the
golden shore.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was plenty of shelter near; rocks abounded
and the vegetation was thick. Alan ran to where a
dozen rocks, man high, rose from the seashore. There
was in one a crevice that was wide enough to admit
Chlorie.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Stay there,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, don’t leave me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I won’t leave you for long I promise you—but I
want to watch for Kulmervan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take care of yourself,” she pleaded. “Oh, run
no risks, I pray.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With a quick glance round Alan left the shelter of
the rocks. No one was in sight—Kulmervan had not
shown himself. Quickly Alan made his way to the
cave from which they had emerged. He entered it,
and to his amazement found it had no exit. Solid
walls blocked his way—it was just a hollowed out rock
on the sands, going inland, perhaps ten or twelve feet
only. Alan was perplexed. He had marked it as he
thought by a big coloured boulder at its entrance; but
upon careful examination he found there were dozens
and dozens of such boulders all over the beach.
Stepping from his hiding place he walked to the next
cave; that upon examination proved to go deep into
the earth, but it was not the cave from which they had
escaped into the open. Wildly he rushed up and down.
Twenty, thirty caves he encountered all like, very like,
the one he was seeking. Some had narrow passages
that twisted and turned and ended in a cave next door.
Others went further, and after many serpentine
turnings, brought him back to the place from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>he had started. He knew he was in a dangerous
position; any one of these caves might hold Kulmervan—an
observer, but unobserved. Rapidly Alan made
up his mind. With Chlorie he would leave the cave
district altogether—they would strike inland. If
they were still on the island, they would endeavour to
find their way back to where the air bird had been
anchored. That Waz-Y-Kjesta would return Alan
was convinced—and when he did so, they would be
saved.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having made up his mind, he began to retrace
his footsteps—but a hoarse burst of laughter startled
him. He rushed to the mouth of the cave. There,
sailing away to sea in a frail craft, was Kulmervan.
It was just a raft he was on, with a tiny makeshift sail.
But it was not at Kulmervan that Alan was staring
horror stricken—incredulous. But at a blue figure near
the helm—a little blue figure that was tied to a post to
which the main-sail was fastened; a little blue figure
that held out her arms imploringly to the shore.
Alan could only stare and stare, incredulous,
unbelieving—but the little craft grew smaller and
smaller as it was tossed on the waves. Alan rushed
to the rocks—the crevice was empty—Chlorie had once
more been snatched from his arms.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>THE WRAITHS OF THE RORKAS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Alan remained motionless, watching the little craft
vanish from his ken. He was thinking hard. Kulmervan
had so far got the better of him, but the game
was not yet won. It might be check to the King, but
Alan was far from being mated. His eye searched the
beach—there was nothing in sight; neither boat, nor
sailing craft. He looked behind him at the many yawning
cavern entrances. He was still in doubt as to the
one which led to the Cave of Whispering Madness. He
clenched his hands together till the knuckles showed
white—there he was, alone on an island, impotent, useless—while
the woman he loved was in the hands of a
madman, and in danger, not of death as he knew it,
but of dishonour, disgrace, and perhaps serquor itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a mist at sea, and already the little barque
had been swallowed up in its grey folds—nothing was in
sight on the broad expanse of water. He looked above
him—he saw no air bird in the heavens, its body gleaming
in the light. On the island there was no trace of
humanity but himself. Hope seemed far away. Then
suddenly he remembered Kulmervan’s words. “Take
the most easterly path, my Waiko. Always to the
East.” Unconsciously he turned to the left, and
walked quickly across the sands. A great promontory
of rock stood out before him, hiding from sight the
next little bay. He strode towards it, and found it was
impossible to get round it. Already the water was too
deep, so he made up his mind to scale it. Clambering
up the slippery rocks, he at length reached the top.
There before him lay the whole stretch of coast line.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Tiny bays; little rivulets coming down narrow valleys
and emptying themselves at last in the sea; rugged
headlands, and grassy slopes all took their place in the
picture. None of these things, however focussed themselves
upon his mind; one thing only he saw, and one
thing only drew him helter skelter over the rugged
rocks. A tiny boat, almost like the Rob Roy canoe he
favoured in his ’varsity days, lay drawn high up on the
beach, and near it, a little log cabin was built at the
water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hurriedly he made his way to the little hut, and
knocked loudly on the door. There was no reply and
he tried it; it opened at his touch. He entered it—it
was deserted, but he soon had proof of its owner.
Upon the wall hung a beautiful painting of Chlorie—and
it was signed “Kulmervan, from his kinswoman.
Chlorie.” On a table by the window was a pile of
books, and on the fly leaf of nearly every one was
written in a strong hand, “Kulmervan, Taz-Ak of the
House of Pluthoz.” Mostly the books were on
Astronomy and Alan noticed with amusement one was
called “Quilphis, or the most important unimportant
Planet.” Quilphis—Terra! His world, once his all—now
nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>He looked round the room, a door led on one side to
the sleeping apartment, and on the other to the kitchen
and offices. The whole place was tastefully furnished
and showed signs of frequent use. Alan hurried to the
seashore—the little craft was called the Chlorie. He
sprang into it, and pushed off. In the bow he saw a
tiny engine with three levers. He was already slightly
acquainted with the simple Keemarnian machinery, so
he pulled one down with assurance. Instantly the boat
skimmed along the water at a terrific speed. Hastily
he touched the second, a slower pace resulted, and the
third stopped the boat altogether. With the first speed
on, he ploughed out to the horizon. He could see no
trace of Kulmervan. The sea was desolate and bare.
He felt hopeless. Had Kulmervan swamped the boat,
and were he and Chlorie now lying dead at the bottom
of the sea? Death! He knew the Jovians had no
death—yet surely they were not immune from drowning?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Perhaps they would remain on the sea’s bed—serquor.
The thought maddened him, and savagely he
turned the boat first this way, then that, in his hopeless
endeavour to find the fugitives. Kymo had sunk, darkness
was setting in—he could see the faint outlines of
the hut. Suddenly two beams of light shone out from
its windows, which were as suddenly obscured. Kulmervan
had doubtless returned. Quickly he turned the
boat towards shore; he drew close in and beached her
without a sound. Quietly he crept up to the open
window and moved the heavy curtain ever so slightly.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was Kulmervan in his easy chair, reading a
book—but he was alone. A knock sounded and a man
appeared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you want refreshment now, my lord?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Arrack. At once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall I take refreshment to the lady, your mate?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Arrack. But stay—take her a glass of wine,
and,” fumbling on his table—“melt this pellet in it.
She will fall asleep. When she is asleep, carry her
hither and place her in my room. ’Tis my wedding
night, Arrack. I have an unwilling bride it’s true, but
before Pirox the Killer, my mate shall she be this
night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Arrack smiled evilly. “’Tis well, my lord. I will
do thy bidding.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When you have brought her hither, stand sentinel
at the rocky ledge. If Alan the Evil should appear,
strike him down, bind him and acquaint me. Should
that happen to him, then Pirox the Killer again will
have a victim.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Silently Arrack left the room to return almost
immediately with a tray laden with food.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where did you go this midday, Arrack?” asked
his master.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the Cave of Whispering Madness, my master.
I built the sacrificial pyre beneath the altar. Everything
is in readiness. I hardly expected you so soon.
Two Kymos should have passed before you came.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The pyre is ready? Good! But what did you
with the Chlorie?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“’Tis on the beach as it always is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay,” said Kulmervan, “when I landed at the
covered bay, I dragged my unwilling bride by way of
the beach. The Chlorie was not there, and I thought
you must have sailed to the mainland for food.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is there I swear, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Kulmervan looked puzzled. “Could Alan have
found it and—” he began—then—“Go quickly,
Arrack, and see.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan slipped round the corner of the hut, and in the
darkness stood flush with the wall, completely hidden.
He saw the figure of Arrack run lightly down to the
beach, heard him get into the boat, and as quickly
return. He reached his coign of vantage in time to
hear Arrack say, “It is there, my lord. I saw and
touched it. It has moved its position slightly, but the
wind has been rather high to-day; otherwise it was as
I left it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That puling girl has taken my senses away,”
grumbled Kulmervan. “I can think of naught but
her. Go, Arrack, fetch her here. But remember, give
her the wine first. When she awakens, she will have
become my mate,” and he chuckled hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was in a quandary, he scarcely knew what to
do. Was the secret way into the place where Chlorie
was hidden, in the cabin or not? He wormed his way
round the hut, and as he did so, he saw a door open,
and in the ray of light a figure cross to a little lean-to
shed, that had been built against some high ground.
He gave Arrack a moment or two of grace and then
followed him in. There on the floor was an open trap
door with some steps leading from it into the unknown
below. A length of cord was in a corner of the shed,
Alan picked it up and then followed Arrack. At the
foot of the steps, a subterranean passage led for
some distance, and then opened out into a large
cave. He remembered it—it was the one immediately
under the secret exit in the Cave of Whispering
Madness.</p>

<p class='c012'>He saw Arrack in front of him—he had taken a key
from his waist and had undone a heavy, metal door.
Silently Alan crept nearer and nearer to him. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>heard the sound of liquid being poured into a glass.
He heard Chlorie’s gentle word of thanks. Now he
could see the grim tragedy. Chlorie had finished the
wine, and was now swaying to and fro; she tottered
and fell on to a low couch in a corner of her prison.
Arrack watched her until he was convinced she was
fast asleep, then he put the wine bottle down and bent
over the prostrate girl. He remembered no more—a
mighty blow rendered him unconscious, and Alan tied
up his unresisting foe, and left him helpless upon the
ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tenderly he raised Chlorie and bent over her—he
was aching to kiss her sweet lips, but he remembered
her anguished cry, “Not my lips, Kulmervan, not
my lips.” No, until she offered them of her own free
will, they should remain sacred to him. He knew she
would sleep deeply for some time, so he examined his
quarters. Chlorie’s cell was hewn out of the solid
rock, with nothing in it but a chair, a table and a
settee. There was the passage leading to the log
cabin; the one with the glimmer of light that led he
knew to the sea shore; and the one to the cave above.
To the right, there was a tiny passage that looked
almost like a crack in the rock. He peered through—it
led on into the distance, and he was determined
to try that. Arrack had carried a lamp which gave
a good light. Alan picked it up, lifted Chlorie gently,
and started down the passage. He wondered whether
it would lead to safety, or to adventures even more
horrible than many of those he had been through.
He held Chlorie tightly; he was determined not to
lose her again. Again the passage opened out into
a cave—narrowed, and a still larger cave came into
view. He saw a niche high up in the wall, and with
his precious burden, he managed to reach it in safety.
He found himself on a high narrow ledge, where they
could rest in safety from the machinations of
Kulmervan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chlorie woke to find her head supported by a strong
arm, and her hands held between two firm ones. She
looked up. “Alan,” she breathed, and made a tiny
movement towards him. “My Chlorie,” he murmured,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>and their lips met in one warm long kiss. “Oh, my
darling, you really love me?” he said brokenly at
last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Alan, I know not the customs of your world.
In mime, it is shame to a maid who offers her lips
before she is wed. Indeed, a maid would never be
thus,” and she slipped from the circle of his arm—“even
were she sworn to wed. I know not your
customs, my Alan, but I am Ipso-Rorka, and my
father’s child. I—I love you, Alan—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you’ll be my wife?” he asked tenderly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shyly she hid her face on his breast “In truth,
my Alan,—’tis sweeter far to be asked, than ask. I
am glad you are of a different world—for your wooing
is stronger and yet more sweet than ours. Oh,
willingly, willingly, Alan, will I marry you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan had at last met and won his ideal, and he
caressed and murmured sweet nothings to her, until
they forgot they were fugitives—forgot that a madman
would soon be on their trail—forgot aught but the
joy of the present, and the hope of the future.
Chlorie recovered herself first. Shyly she slipped her
little hand into Alan’s. “My loved one,” said she.
“My father the Rorka knows naught of Kulmervan
and his sin. We must escape, reach him, and for the
safety of the community, for the traditions of our
dear land, we must send Kulmervan to the Hall of
Sorrows.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My Chlorie, nothing will purge him of his sin.
He is mad—quite mad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he must go away all the same. See what
unhappiness he has caused already—see what he may
do in the future!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are right. He must be put away. He has
money, position and cunning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we, my Alan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know not where this leads,” said Alan, “but it
is the only road I dared take.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hungry, tired and worn, they crept on along the
little narrow ledge. Suddenly a cave, lighted from
without through slits in the wall, burst on their view,
and Chlorie gave a startled exclamation. “The Hall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>of our Fathers,” she cried, “I have been here
before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is the place where the regalia of each reigning
Rorka is placed, together with his throne, when he
has left the fair land of Keemar, through the Sacrament
of Schlerik-itata.” Round the cave were thrones of
all descriptions—some in heavy marble—others in
gold adorned with precious jewels; others just simple,
wooden thrones, that showed their antiquity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Down, down on your knees,” cried Chlorie, and
Alan realized that the cave had become alive with
living figures. The thrones were occupied by men
who wore crowns of gold and jewels, and who carried
sceptre and orb in their hands. The cave that had
been dead and cold only a minute before, was now
alive. But there was no sound; all was hushed and
still, and the figures were shadowy and unreal. “Oh
my Mitzor,” breathed Chlorie. “The joy! To think
I should have been permitted to witness this scene—to
see the wraiths of my forefathers. My Alan, watch—read
a meaning in this visitation, for it augurs well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan felt unable to move. He was petrified at the
sight before him—at the ghostly pageant of years
gone by. Slowly the Rorkas—kings of æons past—rose
from their thrones and walked in single file to
the end of the cave. There they ranged themselves
on either side of a slightly raised platform of rock.
They prostrated themselves, and Alan saw a thin
vapour rise and like a curtain shut out from sight the
little stage. Then it lifted, and through the shadowy
film he saw strange figures disporting themselves amid
the strange scenery. Then, all at once, he realized that
he was watching shadowy figures of himself and Desmond
and Mavis. He saw their little cottage at Arroch
Head; he witnessed their hasty flight in the Argenta;
once more he saw the destruction of the world, his
world. But this time it was different. Like a tiny
star it shone white and bright, then it shivered, turned
red like a tiny ball of fire in the sky, burst into a
thousand different pieces, and then disappeared from
sight. And as it disappeared the scene clouded again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>and the filmy curtain of haze shut out the picture from
his sight. The scene changed—once more he saw
himself as an actor on the stage, but this time he was
a minor character in the drama. Kulmervan was the
villain, and played the chief character. He witnessed
their meeting in the little lane—he watched the flight
of the air bird, Chlorie—the descent, and the abduction
of the Ipso-Rorka. So the play went on until one
more picture showed clearly before him. He saw
Chlorie—Chlorie in a gown of diaphanous white with
a crown of gold upon her head. By her side he stood,
crowned and with orb in hand; and between them
stood a child—a man child who bore traces of his
mother’s beauty and his father’s strength. Then
darkness came upon the scene, and Alan drew his
trembling love still closer beside him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the wraiths of the Rorkas became faint and
misty, and when next he looked, they had vanished
from sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall win through, my Alan,” said Chlorie.
“The wraiths of our Rorkas never show themselves
except to the favoured few.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you know the way out from here?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. Straight through yonder archway a passage
leads to the sea. We are not far from Hoormoori.
The island is Waro—the Isle of Joy. It is a safe place
for Kulmervan to have chosen for his madness—no
one would have sought for evil here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How far is Hoormoori then?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“From where we emerge into the light, we shall
see the citadels and towers of my home. Oh Alan—the
joyous moment when I can take you by the hand
and lead you to my father—my chosen one—my love.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How shall we reach the mainland?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must light a beacon on the shore. Fire is a
signal, and some one will row across to us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In a short while they emerged through a tiny door
out on to the beach. They gathered sticks and laid
them crosswise upon each other until they were man
high, and then set the pile ablaze. At length came a
sign from the distant shore where white minarets
gleamed in the light, and golden cupolas rose high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>in the air. There rose against the whiteness of the
scene tall tongues of flame and curling smoke.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Their answer,” said Chlorie. “Some one will
soon come now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They watched a craft put out to sea—they saw the
pale green sails grow clearer and nearer. Soon they
could distinguish the crew. Chlorie ran down to the
sea’s edge, and stood gaily clapping her hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little launch beached with a groan and a rattle
and a Waz stepped out. “We saw your signal,” he
began, then a look of recognition came over his face
and he fell on one knee and clasped the Princess’ hand
and impressed a loyal kiss upon it. “Oh my Ipso-Rorka,”
he cried. “We have mourned you as serquor.
No tidings could we get of you. Mournings and tears
have been in Hoormoori for ten and one Kymos. The
Rorka has shut himself within the precincts of his
palace, and neither eats nor drinks; but sits always
alone—silent, and quiet, and drear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you for your welcome, my Waz. I have
had strange adventures since I left my father’s house.
These I will tell my people when the right moment
arrives. But first lead me to my father.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The journey to the mainland occupied a very short
space of time, and Waz Okoyar obtained a bhor for
the Ipso-Rorka.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not forget you, Waz Okoyar,” said Chlorie.
“Reward shall be given you for your speedy
assistance to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, my Princess, it is a joy to have served you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hoormoori proved to be even more beautiful than
Minniviar—the streets were wider and the buildings
more magnificent. The bhor stopped outside a marble
building. “I told him to stop here,” whispered
Chlorie. “It is better that I break the news to my
father myself, of my safe return.” They passed
through a noble courtyard into a lovely garden.
“Our own private apartments. I shall be able to get
to my father unnoticed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Through a little door, up a short flight of stairs,
and down a narrow corridor. A heavy curtain of blue
hung outside a doorway. Chlorie lifted it gently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Alan drew back. Much as he loved her, he could not
intrude at such a sacred moment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My child! My child!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was the sound of kissing—a whispered
conversation, and then Alan heard his name. Slowly
he entered the room, and at last was face to face with
the Rorka—King of all Jupiter, but above all, father of
his loved one. The majesty of the Rorka overwhelmed
him, and he bent his knee in homage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, rise,” said a gentle voice, musical, benign,
soothing. “Rise and greet me, oh my Alan, for
Chlorie has told me you are to be my son.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <span class='large'>THE FATE OF KULMERVAN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Hoormoori was rejoicing! Their Princess, Chlorie
the Ipso-Rorka, was found. Not only was she alive
and well, but she had found her mate. True he was
from another world, but she loved him, and the
Jovians, like the men of Terra, dearly loved a
romance. The wedding day was fixed, telepathic
messages had been sent to Sir John, and he and his
party were coming to Hoormoori as guests of the
Rorka.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Rorka was very troubled over Kulmervan.
Never, in the history of Keemar, had such a terrible
tale of iniquity been told. His cunning, his audacity,
his double life was a terrible blow to the proud old
Keemarnian.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta was thankful to welcome Alan back.
Day after day he had circled over the island, and sent
search parties to find the missing ones. The Isle of
Waro, which was joined to the larger isle by a narrow
strip of sand, they left unexplored. It was holy
ground—consequently they missed the log cabin of
Kulmervan. Waz-Y-Kjesta, Alan, and a staff of
twenty men embarked on the Chlorie and flew to
Kulmervan’s retreat. They landed close to the hut,
and although firearms were unknown on Keemar,
they, on Alan’s advice, protected themselves with
heavy sticks and carried thick silken ropes.</p>

<p class='c012'>They found the hut empty and signs of a hasty
retreat. From the little house they crossed to the
“lean-to” and descended into the subterranean
passage. They ascended the steps to the Cave of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Whispering Madness, and forced the door open. The
Cave was empty. Alan looked behind the huge fossil
animal and hoped to find the body of Waiko—but it
had gone. Ominous foot prints on the sandy floor
proved that his body had been found, and Kulmervan
and Arrack had dragged him back to the Altar. As
they reached the slab of stone Y-Kjesta gave a cry of
horror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“See, my Alan. Mitzor have mercy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There on the Altar were the charred remains of what
had once been a man. The bones were twisted into
horrible forms, as if, in their last convulsive agony,
they had writhed in vain on the table of fire. One
bony arm hung over the side. Every scrap of flesh
had been burnt from it—even the tips of the finger
bones were missing. The skull was hairless—the eyes
had been scorched from their sockets. It was a
horrible sight and Alan shivered.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is it?” asked Y-Kjesta.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid it was Waiko. Heaven grant he was
serquor when that madman found him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Gentle hands attempted to move the charred remains
from the bed of pain—but they fell to powder as they
were touched. The whisperings in the Cave served
to make the horrors more intense, and the Keemarnians
turned their heads as they passed the human
sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Down the steps they all travelled, but no trace of
Kulmervan could they find. They forced the outer
entrance to the cave, but although they hunted through
the leafy byways and hidden avenues, he continued to
evade them. Again the cave was searched, and the
Waz was inclined to give up the task.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it possible,” asked Alan at last, “that he is
hiding in the place of the Wraiths of the Rorkas?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. Nothing evil could live in the presence of
our holiest men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nevertheless, I’d like to go there,” suggested
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Waz shrugged his shoulders. “As you will,
my Alan. Remember, of all Keemarnians, only the
Rorkas can visit again the home of their life. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>would not show themselves to such a thing of evil as
Kulmervan has become.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But at the entrance to the Holy Place they saw
Kulmervan. Stiff he was standing, and upon his face
was a frozen look of horror. Y-Kjesta fell to his
knees. “The Wraiths,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>A cloud of haze had passed away, and upon the little
stage was being enacted a drama. High in the air a
great white cloud hovered. It was pink tipped with a
golden glory shining through; at either side were
lesser clouds, but all tinged with the glorious roseate
hue. And in chains beneath them stood the astral
figure of Kulmervan, surrounded by Keemarnians who
had gone before. And as they watched, his clothes
melted away, and naked and ashamed he stood before
his judge—the great white glory. Gradually a dusky
shadow seemed to come over the gleaming body,
darker and darker it grew until it was jet black. Not
the black of an African native, but a cruel black; a
thick black that was horrible to look upon, so evil
was its appearance. Then all the Keemarnians shrank
away from the solitary evil figure standing alone before
the glory. The shadowy figure of Kulmervan looked
round him wildly, and threw out his hands in supplication.
It was no use. His prayers were too late. A
yawning pit showed up bright with flames. Yellow
tongues of flame licked round the mouth—long, red
flames danced together in riotous harmony. Then out
of the terrible place appeared a figure, so terrible that
Alan closed his eyes and strove at once to forget it.
A figure that was neither man nor animal, but part
of both. A creature with bloodshot eyes and a baleful
smile, with teeth that looked like fangs, with arms
that twisted and twirled like evil serpents. Nearer and
nearer the figure drew, until, radiating with heat, it
drew close to Kulmervan. There was a mighty noise—the
Great White Cloud vanished leaving the scene
in a pitchy darkness—only the fiery cavern gleamed
and glistened. The venomous figure put a sinewy arm
about the form of Kulmervan—there was a crackling
noise—the hideous smell of burning flesh, and the
picture vanished as the two figures disappeared into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the fiery jaws. Then Y-Kjesta spoke. “The Great
White Glory has judged. We cannot punish now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a fearsome shriek, and Kulmervan rushed
from the cave, and fell prostrate on the ground outside.
Y-Kjesta stooped over him. The body was rigid—the
eyes fast closed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Serquor has descended upon him,” said the Waz.
“Righteousness has spoken.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With an awed feeling, Alan watched them pick up
the body and carry it to the air bird, and as they did
so a mighty roar filled the air. There was a sound as
of thunder—a blinding flash—then silence. The Cave
of Whispering Madness had gone! Shivered to
atoms, there was nothing but a hillock of rocks and
sand to mark the last resting place of Waiko the
Unfortunate. The little passage to the Sacred Cave
alone remained perfect. When the last shock of the
earthquake had subsided, Arrack the servant came out
from his hiding, and threw himself upon the mercy
of Alan. Firmly he was bound, and taken to the
Chlorie, there to await the judgment of the Rorka.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My son,” said the Rorka, when he had been told
the whole story. “Kulmervan was shown his future
punishment. He may not be suffering now, for he is
in the unhappy state of serquor—but some day, when
he leaves this world, his time of pain will come. A
case of glass shall be made to hold his cold and rigid
body. In the Hall of Sorrows shall it be placed as a
living testimony of the fruit that is garnered by evil.
To Fyjipo the accursed shall be taken—there to remain,
until he changes the state of serquor, for his lasting
punishment.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE SENTENCE UPON ARRACK</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sir John, with Masters, Desmond and Mavis arrived
at Hoormoori in time for the trial. They were much
interested in Alan’s adventures, and were looking
forward to witnessing the spectacle of Jovian justice.
Mavis and Chlorie were already warm friends, and the
Rorka insisted on the strangers occupying suites of
apartments in his palace. Baby John Alan had grown
into a fine boy. Now nearly four, he toddled about
the palace and chattered away in a quaint mixture of
Keemarnian and English. The grown-ups seldom used
English now—their past life seemed to be fading away
entirely; they were already acclimatized to Jupiter and
looked upon it as their home. Mavis at the bottom
of her heart, however, did not forget all the pretty
customs in which she had been brought up from childhood
and she it was who introduced a trousseau as a
necessary adjunct to a wedding. Chlorie took up the
idea with fervour, and in future all society weddings
had trousseaux, cakes and honeymoons as essential
parts of their festivities.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chlorie’s mother had heard the call of Schlerik-itata
when she was but a small child, and possessing no
near feminine relatives, the Keemarnian Princess was
glad to have Mavis helping her at the happiest time
of her life. All was bustle and rush at the palace.
The wedding was to be a grand affair, but before it
took place, Arrack had to answer publicly the charges
that were brought against him. In the large Justice
Hall, on the day appointed, the Rorka took his seat
wearing his purple robes of Justice.</p>

<p class='c012'>A fanfare of trumpets announced his arrival, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>his postillions and servants and attachés. All wore
full court dress, and the whole scene was picturesquely
brilliant. Alan had not yet been admitted to the
highest circles in Jovian society; his honour was to
come on his wedding day—so to meet the exigencies
of the case, a special raised seat had been placed at
the right hand of the Rorka, and there Alan sat in
state and watched the proceedings. There were
neither lawyers nor barristers in this wonderful land
of harmony. The case for the defence, if so it could
be called, was taken by the High Priest—and for the
prosecution by the highest Djoh in the whole of
Keemar.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Rorka listened to the statements made on both
sides, and gave his sentence as he thought fairest. No
appeal could be made afterwards; his judgment was
final. Never had there been such a case as this one.
Arrack had broken the traditions of his land. If the
Rorka adjudged him guilty, he would take his punishment
stoically. The Rorka rose, and the silence in
the court was profound. “Bring in Arrack the
Miserable,” he cried, and Arrack appeared in the
prisoner’s garb of an ugly neutral tint. This garment
of shame was worn only by prisoners, when charged
with some heinous offence. It was something of the
shape of a Jewish gaberdine. About his waist the
prisoner wore a hempen rope; his head was covered
with a hood, and there were sandals upon his feet.
“O Arrack,” said the Rorka, “take your seat upon
the Penitent’s Chair, for you are accused by this court
of most grievous dealings. If you are found guilty,
a terrible fate awaits you. Speak first, Lamii, Djoh of
all Keemar, read your charge first.” And Djoh
Lamii, a dignified old greybeard, stepped forward and
read from a parchment.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rorka, most mighty, by the grace of Mitzor,
Keemarnians one and all, I charge Arrack the Miserable
with grievous sins. Whether he alone is
responsible or whether responsibility rests with another—unnamed,
but now in a state of serquor—remains
to be proved. First, I charge Arrack with idolatry
and devil worship,—nay more, I charge him with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>greatest offence of all against Mitzor—the offence of
offering black sacrifices, the sacrifice of living bodies,
to Pirox the Killer, a graven image of hideous aspect.
I charge him with acting as assistant in that Temple
of Sin and Death. I charge him as a heretic and a
heathen. He, a born believer in the one and only
Creator, is a deserter from his faith. I charge him
with aiding the unnamed, now serquor, in his horrible,
nefarious practices. All these charges are with regard
to his sins against Mitzor. Now I charge him with
attempting to lay hands on the precious person of our
loved Princess; with offering her wine that was
drugged, and being a party to keeping her a captive
against her will. Above all, I charge him with trying
to aid the unnamed, now serquor, to soil her purity,
and thus to cause her to wed one she did not love.
These, O Rorka, are the sins in brief, and a more
hideous category of evil, I have never before had
to repeat. Although I am old, and my call must
come soon, this is the saddest day of my life to think
I have to utter such things against a true Keemarnian.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He sat down, and then rose up Misrath the High
Priest. “O Rorka, the mighty and the just. I cannot
deny the charges that Lamii has brought. Long have
I talked with Arrack the Miserable, and it is hard to
offer even a word in his favour. Yet because of thy
justice I beg of you to hear me out, and I will tell
the tale of sorrow and shame. Arrack and the
unnamed, now serquor, were foster brothers. The
mother of the unnamed received her call while her
babe was yet a suckling, and these two babes, suckled
from the same breast, drew the food of life from the
same woman. As toddling mites they flew their kites
together, and threw their balls. Then the sire of
Arrack, Meol, now serquor, took these suckling babes
to the Temple of Pirox the Killer. It is he I blame,
not the innocent ones. He, with two others, lived a
life of lies. Respected Keemarnians, wise fathers,
loving husbands, they lived unsuspected of their
evil practices; for they were all devil worshippers and
offered up the black sacrifice. But serquor took them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>all into his bosom. These tender nurslings grew in
the ways of sin. He, the unnamed, possessed brains
and cunning. He was the leader. He it was who
took Arrack the Miserable on to our Isle of Holiness—made
him build him a hut, and left him there, a tool
to work his will and prepare his heathen rites. Since
he was of tender years he has led this life—hating it,
yet loving it; fearing it, yet welcoming it. Then the
time came when he, the unnamed, whispered words
that affrighted even Arrack the Miserable. Whispered
words of passion for a Princess. The Ipso-Rorka was
named—and even to that length of degradation would
Arrack have assisted, so deep was he in the toils of
sin. Then the day of reckoning came. Mighty
thunders shook the Cave of Darkness. The wrath of
Mitzor tore it asunder; no more shall these perfidious
practices be handed down from father to son. No
longer shall sin creep out unseen in Keemar. The
Great White Glory has spoken. The Temple of Sin
is in ruins, and under the mass of rock and stones lies
the tortured body of Waiko. Whether he, too, had
practised the sins of the unnamed also, we know not.
But we do know his character was weak. We pray
that his suffering on the Black Altar may have purged
his soul and that soon he will be sitting in the warmth
of the Tower of Help.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Misrath sat down, and the Rorka rose. “I have
heard your case, O Arrack, in silence. I have listened
to your tale of shame. One thing only is in your
favour. You sought not an evil life, but sin and its
sorrows were taught you when you were yet a child.
But—” he paused. “You lived the life of Keemar.
You attended our services of joy that were offered to
Mitzor. You knew sin was abhorrent to us. From
the time when our first parents populated our world,
we have fought to keep Keemar perfect. Thanks to
Mitzor we nearly succeeded. It is to prevent the
occurrence of sins like yours that I pronounce
sentence. Misrath, High Priest of our Temples—our
Mediator on earth between Mitzor and man, robe the
sinner in the garments of shame.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Immediately the grey tinted gaberdine was torn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>from Arrack, and in its place was put a long robe of
black. The covering was taken from his head, and
the sandals from his feet. His head was bowed in
shame, and in shame he was led to the Sentence Bar,
there to hear his fate.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Through the streets of Hoormoori shalt thou be
led,” said the Rorka. “A rope round thy middle shall
direct thee the way to go. Neither man nor woman
shall speak to thee. Neither beast nor bird shall be
permitted to fawn upon thee. Alone and an outcast
shalt thou be sent upon thy way. Lonely shalt thy
days be. Lonely shalt thou be taken to the Hall of
Sorrows at Fyjipo. There thou shalt live until thy
beard grows and turns white with age. Should thy call
come early, alone wilt thou have to meet the Great
White Glory. No Sacrament shall help thee on thy
way. Neither incense nor prayers shall assist thee in
thy last moments here. Alone and wretched thou shalt
leave this world. But should thy call not come soon,
then shalt thou stay in the Hall of Sorrows until thy
beard covers thy face and thy middle, then—when that
time arrives, shalt thou be free to leave the place of
sorrow. But thy life will be lonely all thy days for
the sins thou hast committed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Misrath rose. “Oh my Rorka, thy wisdom is
sound, thy judgment just. May I ask but one favour
for the guilty Arrack? During his time of sorrows,
should he perform two noble deeds wouldst thou
reconsider thy verdict and allow him freedom?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Misrath. Should he perform two noble
deeds, deeds that mark him as a true son of Keemar,
then publicly shall his punishment be remitted him, and
once more shall he take his place among the people
he has wronged. I have spoken.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Rorka rose from his seat of justice, and with
another fanfare of trumpets took his place in his state
bhor and drove to the palace. Alan waited to see the
end. The wretched Arrack was led from his place,
and taken through a side entrance out on to the
highway. There a rope was twisted round his waist,
a rope that had six ends. Six men took hold of each
end, and dragging it taut, led him through the streets.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>On he went, a misery to himself, and to those that
saw him.</p>

<p class='c012'>An air bird was made ready for the journey to Fyjipo.
Alan begged that he might accompany it. He wanted
to see for himself what the Hall of Sorrows was really
like. He had no conception of it. Was it like a
Pentonville or Portland in England, or did it possess
some horror that no ordinary human mind could
conceive?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go then,” said the Rorka to Alan. “Swift be thy
journey there, and as swift return. Just time shalt
thou have before the day arrives when Misrath shall
make my child and thee—one. One on earth and one
in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Farewell,” said Chlorie, when Alan told her of
the journey he was to make. “’Tis customary in
Keemar for a bride to withdraw herself from all for
twelve Kymos before her wedding day. During that
time she thinks and meditates on her future state. I
go into silence to-morrow, Alan, and my prayers will
be all for you. May you return to me in safety.
Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The air struck cold and Alan was glad of the heavy
cloaks that the Rorka insisted on his taking for the
journey. They had passed through glorious scenery,
but now it was changing. No longer was the air
sweet and balmy; no longer were the fields below
covered with beautiful flowers. Great stretches of
bare and rocky country took the place of the fields,
and snow-topped hills looked down on the desolation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Fyjipo hove in sight. One great building
dominated the scene. Of a dark grey stone it looked
gloomy and forbidding. Kulmervan, still in the state
of serquor, had been brought in a coffin of glass, and
Alan felt the awful loneliness of the place, when he
saw the coffin being unshipped, preparatory to being
placed in the Hall of that dreadful abode. The Waz,
who was in command of the journey held the only key
to the heavy gates, and as he unfastened them, a drear
wailing rose from within.</p>

<p class='c012'>Arrack was dragged along, pushed inside the gate,
and then left—to learn how to fend for himself in
that gloomy place. Carefully was Kulmervan placed
upon a huge pedestal in the hall. His face had lost
its youthful candour, its beauty of outline and its
peace. The visage seen through the glass, was the
face of an old man worn with sin; evil and sinister.
Alan shuddered as he turned away from the coarsened
form. The state of serquor as known by the
Keemarnians was a very dreadful thing. Struck
down in life, the victims assumed a trance-like form
from which they never recovered. Real death the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Jovians knew not; a far happier parting was permitted
them. As in a dream a voice told the sleeper that
his time had come—that so many more Kymos would
pass before he would have to bid his world good-bye.
Then in the Sacrament of Schlerik-itata his body and
soul were rendered astral, and in a cloud of smoke
the favoured one disappeared from sight, and entered
into dwelling with his God. It was a wonderful end;
there could be no great sadness at such a departure;
no corruption was to be the lot of the departing Jovian—he
was just carried into glory. But those poor
souls that suffered serquor remained in their comatose
condition. Alive yet dead! Dead yet alive! Useless
to themselves, and of use to no one! No wonder it
was the one dreaded thing in this land of all good.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were but fifty bodies in the condition of
serquor on the whole of Keemar, and most of them
had been there for many ages. None could remember
some of them as creatures full of life; their names
were written on tablets and placed above them—their
only connection with the generation of the present.
In a small, underground chapel in the Temple at
Hoormoori were these poor ones kept. Niches,
cushion-lined were made in the walls, and in these the
victims were laid. There they would remain until
Jupiter itself returned to its first void, and emptied
its population into the lap of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I beg you stay not long here, my Lord,” said the
Waz to Alan. “’Tis an evil place, and I would fain
hurry and leave it far behind me”.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, my Waz. Stay until the Kymo rises full in
the Heavens—’tis but a short time now, and then I
shall be ready to accompany you”.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were no separate degrees of punishment in the
Hall of Sorrows. The real punishment lay in its
awful loneliness. The Keemarnians who were there
were paying dearly for their faults. Utter loneliness—comfortless—cheerless—it
was desolation personified.
Those were the first impressions that Alan received.
Food was let down from the air at certain intervals.
There was no division, and only just sufficient to go
round. It was a question of first come, first served,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and the man who appeared last received little if any
of his portion. No lighting was arranged in the place,
and as it was near the Pole, half their time was spent
in total blackness. There was no warmth; it was cold
and draughty; no privacy; no comfort.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Keemarnians who offended purged themselves
clean in this dread place of sorrow. Once they were
free of it, they never put themselves into the position
to be sent there again. Their terms of incarceration
varied. For some it might be for only six Kymos;
for others sixty or even six hundred! The worst
sinner there had nothing on his conscience one
quarter as bad as Arrack the Miserable; but he was
sent there too, to consort with them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan could not bear to stay in the place. The
atmosphere stifled him—the sight depressed him. His
last view of Arrack, was of a lonely figure in a gown
of black, sitting drearily in a corner of the big Hall,
watching intently the still form of his late master.
His hands were clasped, his expression hopeless—his
whole attitude one of despair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s very terrible,” said Alan to the Waz as they
sailed away from Fyjipo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is, my Lord?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your Hall of Sorrows.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why, my Lord?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely it must do more harm than good?” The
Waz looked amazed. “I know if I were sent to such
a place, I should come out hardened and defiant.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Jovian smiled. “That is where we differ, my
Alan. The Keemarnian hates evil of every kind.
This dread is born in him. He offends—ever so
slightly. The Priest remonstrates with him. He
makes promises to atone, but offends again. No
second chance is given him. Straight to the Hall of
Sorrows he is sent, there to live in discomfort, cold
and solitude. He is too ashamed to mix with his
fellow creatures; so his sin is purged and he comes
out a better man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan laughed slightly at the Keemarnian’s earnestness.
“I am afraid, my friend, that the world I
came from was more material than yours. A life in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>such a place would have led to worse sin—it would
not have cured it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then I am glad I belong to Keemar,” said the
Waz simply.</p>

<p class='c012'>They made the return journey in record time, and
Desmond and Mavis were waiting for Alan on the
roof station when the air bird sailed in.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Welcome home,” said Mavis. “We have missed
you badly. However everything is ready for you, and
in three more Kymos we will have you safely married.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you so anxious to get rid of me?” laughed
Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No,” answered Mavis with a happy smile, “but
I’ve tasted the joys myself, and I want you to find
your happiness also, my brother.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s very nicely put, Mavis,” said Alan tenderly.
“I could wish for no one but you for Desmond. At
first I was a little jealous when I thought his affection
for me would be halved.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not halved, Alan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, that’s not the right word. But Desmond and
I had been everything to each other from our
childhood, and then you came—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now I understand what it means, and am glad
I am going to partake of the same kind of happiness
that Desmond enjoys.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sure you’ll be happy, Alan. Chlorie is so
sweet—so human, so understanding. But—” there
came a perplexed note into her voice. “I’m afraid of
only one thing, Alan. You are sure you are not too—too
material—for these Jovians. You are going to
mate with a girl almost—spiritual, if I may so put it.
Now—the time is drawing near, I’m so afraid—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t be afraid, little woman. I’ve learnt a great
deal since I came here. The past is growing dim.
My love for Chlorie is so great that I think it is cancelling
all my earthly senses. I have only one fear for
the future.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And that is?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My inborn dread of death. Not that I fear death
for myself, but dread its coming and separating me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>from my love. She will not have that fear. Until I
can comfort myself in the belief of Schlerik-itata, I
shall have that fear always with me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Death!” Mavis looked dreamily into the
distance where her son and his father were romping
together. “I think I, too, have a tiny bit of fear
left,” said she, “but I am trying to put it away. We
have left the old world behind us. I was wrong to
put doubts in your heart, Alan. You’ve chosen wisely,
I am sure. Good luck and good fortune be yours!”</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRIUMPH OF AK-ALAN</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The populace of Hoormoori were wildly excited, for
the time had come when their Princess, the Ipso-Rorka
of all Keemar, was to wed. Every place was full, the
streets were thronged with visitors, for people had
come from all parts of Jupiter to witness the long
ceremonies and jubilations that preceded the actual
wedding. Parties came from the warmth of Xzor,
from the heat of Paila, from the temperate breezes
of the Isles of Kalœ. Every dwelling house in Hoormoori
was full; every public guest house had used
every available space for their overflowing guests.
The streets were gaily decorated; the trees were
adorned with coloured lights, and across the wide
boulevards silken flags were hung. There were
festoons of flowers and leaves everywhere. Every
window was bright with silken rugs; the whole scene
was gay and brilliant.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first ceremony of interest was the admittance
of Alan into the bosom of the Rorka’s family. In a
wonderful golden robe Alan stood at the foot of the
Rorka’s throne in the great white Throne Room in
the palace. The whole apartment was thronged with
guests, and by the Rorka’s side sat the Princess. She
had on her face a grave, sweet smile, and in her court
robes of blue and gold she made a regal figure.</p>

<p class='c012'>A majordomo handed the Rorka a golden fillet of
beautiful workmanship studded with diamonds. This
was placed on Alan’s head by the Rorka himself, who
said—“Oh Alan, known hence forward by the
Royal prefix of Ak—I salute thee. Thou hast taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the oaths of allegiance to me, your Rorka. Thy
fidelity and love thou hast offered me. I salute thee,
Oh Ak-Alan,” and he took him by both hands, and
kissed him on either cheek, and raised him to the
topmost step of the throne. Then Alan faced the
people.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Behold him,” said the Rorka. “Ak-Alan, a noble
of the House of Pluthoz. Acclaim him as your own,
for he is indeed a Prince of the House of your Rorka.”</p>

<p class='c012'>How the people cheered! With one accord they
shouted and surged forward to the foot of the throne,
and stretched out their hands to their newly made
prince. Alan was delighted with his reception, and
had an individual word to say to nearly every one who
came near him. The story of his adventure for
Chlorie had been widely told; Kulmervan’s treachery
was known; and every one welcomed the newcomer
royally. But this was only the beginning. Ak-Alan
had to become a Djoh of the Outer Shelter, and
to receive the blue ribbon of his office. The Golden
Circle of Unity of Keemar was placed on his finger—The
Star of Joy—The Order of Hope—all these
ceremonies took their time. But they were all
picturesque and interesting.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many times had he looked upon Chlorie, but never
had an opportunity been given to him to speak with
her alone. But at his ardent gaze, the shy colour
would mount her cheeks, and her eyes would drop in
sweet embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta had been appointed to the Royal
Household of Ak-Alan, and was delighted to have the
opportunity to remain by the side of the friend he had
made. Persoph the Jkak, and Mirasu the Jkakalata
had sent handsome presents to Alan and Chlorie, and
had expressed their sorrow when Desmond had
announced his intention of settling down in Hoormoori.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We want to be near Alan,” explained Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall miss you of course. We are grateful for
your kindness to us all since we arrived so strangely
in your land. But we should miss the society of our
kinsman, we must stay near him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We understand,” said Persoph. “But visit us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>my friends, and allow us to visit you. Your friendship
is dear to us—your esteem we prize.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Several orders had been offered Sir John, but he
stuck to his prefix throughout. “My father earned
it,” he explained. “I honour him by using it. Please
allow me to keep it,” and the Rorka gave his
permission. During all this time Masters had scarcely
left Sir John’s side. A devoted friend, a loyal servant,
he remained always at hand in case the old man needed
him. And when Alan had been appointed Ak of the
House of Pluthoz, Masters received the shock of his
life. Suddenly the majordomo cried out, “And I
command Masters of the household of Sir John to
kneel at the foot of the Rorka’s throne.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters turned dead white, and looked appealingly
at Sir John.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Go forward, my friend,” said Sir John, and
Masters obeyed him.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Rorka rose, and touched him lightly with the
Silver Staff of Office of a Waz. “I promote thee
henceforward, Waz, to the house of Sir John. Waz-Masters
shalt thou be, with all that appertains thereto.
Accept this staff, Waz-Masters, for thou art a faithful
friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Masters was unable to express his gratitude, the
honour was so unexpected that it rendered him
speechless; but a few moments later Alan smiled as
he saw him talking earnestly with Zyllia, a kinswoman
of Y-Kjesta’s. And as Alan watched the luminous
eyes that smiled at Masters, watched the parted lips
and the colour that came and went in the olive tinted
cheeks of the beautiful Keemarnian, he foresaw, and
foresaw truly, that soon Masters would forsake the
lonely role of bachelor; and another love match would
be made in Keemar—the land of all good.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came the feasts and banquets; a pageant and
procession through the streets of Hoormoori. Bhors
gaily decorated, fancifully costumed bands, dancing
children dressed like wood nymphs, fair-headed, slim
youths with pipes like the pipes of Pan, woodland
fairies, ladies in court attire, all took part in this
wonderful procession.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>And Alan sat on a balcony in the Royal Palace and
watched it. But half the time his eyes were feasting
on the features of his bride of the morrow. Occasionally,
under cover of the cheers and the darkness, his
hand would stray out, and for a moment clasp hers
in the darkness. But no chance had he of speaking
with her alone, and her nearness maddened him with
passionate longings. He longed to be alone with her,
away in the woods and fields, along the seashore, just
they two together, communing with nature in all her
glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>“May I not speak to Chlorie a moment alone?”
he begged earnestly.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Rorka smiled. “In your world, perhaps, it
would be allowed. But I cannot sanction it. To-day
she belongs to me—to the people. To-morrow she
will be yours for ever. It is custom, my son. But
to-morrow—” he stopped, and looked shrewdly at
Alan. “I have been converted to your—‘honeymoon’.
It is a strange idea to us of Keemar, but
a beautiful one, and will, I think, prove popular with
my countrymen. To-morrow you take her away—alone.
No duenna’s guiding eye will follow you.
The House of Roses in the Wyio Forest is at your
disposal. It is ready—prepared. I have given way
on many points, my son, but on this one I am firm.
You cannot speak alone to Chlorie to-night. Now I
wish to speak to Sir John.” Alan bowed his head and
moved away, so that his uncle could take his place.
He was further away from his love, but sat in the
shadow and gloried in her as the light shone brightly
on her profile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir John,” said the Rorka, “I have heard much
about your wonderful airship that carried you safely
to our world. Would you be prepared to build another
as like it as possible? I will place men, material and
means at your disposal. You need want for nothing,
and I should esteem it a personal favour if you would
at least consider my proposal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir John’s eyes shone. “O Rorka, you have put
new life into me by your suggestion. I felt I was
growing old—but my heart is still young. To be of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>use in your world will make my last years happy;
to feel I am not wasting my time will strengthen my
life. Masters and I were planning another Argenta
on paper only to-day. He has been examining the
metal you use, and he says it is even lighter and
stronger than our aluminium. My whole time is at
your disposal, and Masters’ as well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Speak for yourself, Sir John,” smiled the Rorka.
“But unless I am much mistaken, Zyllia will have
more to say about Waz-Masters’ affairs than you have
dreamt of.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Zyllia?” repeated Sir John looking puzzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look behind you,” said the Rorka. In the room
behind were two figures—Masters and a woman. The
woman was delicately beautiful. Darker than most
Keemarnian women, with blue black hair and flashing
eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So he has found a mate,” said Sir John softly.
“I never thought of Masters and marriage. He
seemed too mature. In our world he would have been
called ‘middle-aged’ He has seen forty and three
summers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But Zyllia is mature,” said the Rorka. “She looks
a girl, but although her soul is young, she and Masters
are not far apart in years.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will not object to the match?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay. I have a great opinion of Waz-Masters, but
I like not his name.” He touched a bell. “Waz-Masters
and the Lady Zyllia. I desire them here at
once.” The girl bowed, and in a moment the two
were standing before him. “My friend,” said the
Rorka kindly, “I like not your name. Waz-Masters
sounds crude and harsh. In our language we have a
far softer word that means ‘Master’ Henceforward
shall you be known by that. Waz-Aemo, for now and
ever.” Masters remained silent. He was embarrassed
and hardly knew what to do. “So you are going to
mate with Zyllia?” said the Rorka. Zyllia bent on
one knee, her hands extended in supplication. “Oh
Rorka, most noble. Have I thy permission? Him
have I promised to wed, if I have thy permission. For
I love this stranger dearly.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>“My consent was given long ago. I have watched
your play with pleasure, my child. Tell Waz-Y-Kjesta
he can give you the use of an air bird for your—your
honeymoon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh how can I thank you—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is enough. See, the procession has resumed—how
beautiful are the flowers—the silks—” and
taking these words as their dismissal, they bent on
one knee, and then passed from the balcony to the
room beyond.</p>

<p class='c012'>The last vehicle had passed, the last burst of music
had died away, night fell. But one more ceremony
remained to conclude the time of rejoicing—the
wedding on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan woke early on the morning of his wedding day.
His personal attendant had placed all his wedding
clothes ready for him, and he donned the golden robe
and swung from his shoulders the blue velvet cloak.
It was lined with gold, and caught up at one corner
with a beautiful jewelled buckle. His fillet of gold
was on his head, and as he looked at himself in the
long glass he saw the romantic robes fade away,
leaving in their place a worn and shabby, but nevertheless
very comfortable golf jacket. The shadowy
figure was carrying a bag over his shoulder—golf
clubs. Alan sighed. It was a very long time since
he had teed up, and with a mighty drive seen a little
white ball sent skimming along at a terrific pace. He
could see the ascent to the approach of his favourite
green; the green itself, smooth and velvety, resting in
a little hollow below. Well, he would get his game
of golf on Jupiter. He would plan a course, have
clubs made, and he and Chlorie would—No, he didn’t
regret giving up the old and ugly garments of the
earth. He regretted nothing. He wouldn’t have
altered his fate if it had been in his power to do so.
Life held nothing for him but Chlorie. Life and love
were before him, and he felt fitted for and happy in the
new world.</p>

<p class='c012'>His golden, sandal-like boots were on. The ring for
Chlorie was in his satchel purse. The Crown of
Wifehood with which he would presently crown her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>was in Y-Kjesta’s possession. The Waz also had
taken care of the gifts, which according to the rites
of the Temple he must present to his wife. The coins,
to represent that he endowed her with his wealth.
The loaf divided in two—to denote that she would
share in everything. The fresh cut flowers, a symbol
of the joys they would find in each other, and lastly the
basket of fruits that were to be laid on the Altar and
offered as a burnt offering to Mitzor the Mighty. As
they were reduced to ashes, the High Priest would
waft them to the four winds of heaven, and the nuptial
pair would swear to love each other until such time
arrived as the burnt fruits regained their virgin
freshness. A poetical way of vowing their eternal
fidelity each to the other.</p>

<p class='c012'>Waz-Y-Kjesta entered. He was plainly nervous at
the thought of the part he was to play in the day’s
ceremony. “The time has come, my Alan. Your
bhor awaits you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am ready,” Alan smiled at the Waz. “I don’t
know how I should get on without you to-day.” The
streets were thronged with people. Alan sat alone in
the State Bhor which drove slowly down the decorated
streets, and immediately in front of the bridegroom’s
equipage rode Y-Kjesta, on a magnificent white coli.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sixteen Keemarnians, appointed by the Rorka for
his personal staff, rode behind him. Sir John and
Desmond were already in the Temple. A beautiful
blue carpet spread from the door to the street, and the
whole way was lined with flowers. Slowly Alan
walked up the flowered aisle and took his place at the
altar rails. The organ was playing softly. Suddenly
it burst out into the Ipso-Rorka’s personal air—The
Bride had arrived. On the arm of the Rorka she
walked up the long aisle. Her bridal gown of blue
brought out the colour of her eyes. Upon her hair
was draped a thin veil of gold, and her long train
was carried by little sturdy John Alan! At the altar
rails they stopped, and the High Priest demanded—“Who
giveth permission, that this woman shall leave
her home and her people, and live in peace with the
mate of her choice?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“I do,” said the Rorka.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are convinced that happiness and joy will be
the woman’s lot?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks be to Mitzor. I am content.” Thereupon
the Rorka took his seat upon his throne, and the
ceremony commenced.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis, who had followed the bridal procession, now
took her place on Chlorie’s left, to assist the bride.
It was a beautiful ceremony, and the incense, the
priest’s vestments, the music, all helped to make it
awe inspiring and impressive. The gifts were offered—Chlorie
accepted them—the moment was almost at
hand that would make them one. Alan was repeating
softly after the priest—</p>

<p class='c012'>“May this ring, with which I encircle thy finger, be
a lasting proof of the unity of our affection. May the
circlet with which I crown thee, prove that I honour
thee as my loved one, and install thee as Queen of
my House.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And Chlorie answered softly, “I accept this ring, and
from my finger it shall never slip. I accept the crown
that thou offerest me, and in return I pray Mitzor the
Mighty, that I may rule my household wisely and well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came the vows of love and fidelity; each
repeated the words with hands clasped.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Before Mitzor the Mighty, the Great White Glory,
I promise to let naught come between my chosen
spouse and me. I promise to love him (her) and
honour him (her), share his (her) troubles, and smooth
away his (her) griefs. Lastly, I ask Mitzor, the Tower
of Strength, to crown us both with the glory of our
union.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, kneeling, the High Priest blessed them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“May Mitzor, the Great White Glory, bless you
both, and keep you both in the paths of righteousness.
May he make thee, Oh Ak-Alan, a tender husband;
and thee, Chlorie, a loving wife. Thy vows are made—kneel
and pray while the sacrificial fires are lighted,
and the dust of thy offering is thrown to the winds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hand in hand the newly married pair knelt. Into a
tiny tabernacle the offering of fruits was placed—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>doors closed upon it. A second passed, and by the
aid of etheric heat there was nothing left but a little
powdery dust.</p>

<p class='c012'>Slowly the priests and the acolytes walked down the
aisle, the bridal pair following. With prayers and
exhortations the dust was scattered, and wafted out
of sight by the breeze. The ceremony was over—a
hymn of joy was sung, and Alan and Chlorie were led
to their bhor that was waiting.</p>

<p class='c012'>They drove together in the open bhor, and Chlorie
could not speak—her heart was too full of emotion.
The excitement, the cheering, the crowds tired her—and
yet there was still the reception to get through.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not a word had she spoken to her newly made
husband, but as they alighted he whispered—“You
don’t regret, my darling?”</p>

<p class='c012'>She gave him a quick, shy glance, but it satisfied
him. They had to wait for the congratulations of the
intimate friends and guests, but at last Mavis whispered,
“Come, dear, it is time for you to change into your
other frock.” Quietly the bride left the reception
and changed into her other gown. Tenderly she bade
her father good-bye.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye, my little one,” he murmured, “Mitzor
take care of you. In forty Kymos I shall come for
you. Be happy in your new life.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye, my father.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will find everything in readiness at the House
of Roses,” said Waz-Y-Kjesta.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were renewed cheers, the band played—and
the comfortable equipage drove off, bearing the
happiest couple in all Keemar.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My darling,” murmured Alan, when they were
at last outside the town, and running swiftly through
quiet country roads. “Are you sure you won’t regret
this day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never, my Alan,” she replied, her eyes smiling
as she nestled close to her husband—“but Alan, I
think I am a little frightened all the same.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For answer he crushed her in his arms, and rained
passionate kisses on her unresisting lips—and it sufficed
her. She was content.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>THE PERFECT WORLD</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Many hundred times the Kymo rose and set, and
Ak-Alan and his wife, beloved of all Keemarnians,
lived in peace and happiness. A son and daughter had
been born to them, and now the time had come when
the Rorka had received his call, and through the
Sacrament of Schlerik-itata would make his exit from
the world, and enter into glory.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My son,” said he, “the voice came in my sleep
last night. My room was bathed in a wonderful
whiteness when the messenger from Mitzor called me.
‘When the Kymo reaches the full for thirteen days
make ready—for on the fourteenth thou shalt meet
the Great White Glory.’ I must now set my house
in order. You will reign jointly with Chlorie. I can
safely leave my country in your hands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Father,” said Alan, “must you really leave us?”
He was troubled. “Oh it’s terrible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why?” said Chlorie. “I shall miss my father
it is true—for I love him dearly. But how can I wish
him here, when his happiness lies yonder?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t understand,” said Alan miserably. “Death
is so sad.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it is not—death—” said the Rorka. “I am
simply—‘going away’.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s just it. You are going away, and you are
never coming back.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is true, my son. <i>I</i> am never coming back—but
you will eventually come to me. Why mourn?
To mourn is selfish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s no good,” said Alan. “I suppose I am of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>coarser clay. I can’t believe that I could ever ‘pass
yonder’ through the Sacrament of Schlerik-itata. I
come from another world. Suppose I die—oh you
don’t know death as I do—but suppose it comes to
Keemar through me, and afterwards through my
children.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have no fear,” said the Rorka, “that day will
never come.” And so the last few days had passed,
and Alan saw him enveloped in the incense, and vanish
from sight.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan marvelled at his wife’s fortitude. He had felt
the knife of death on Terra; this glorious parting was
so different. He longed to believe that he, too, one
day, would vanish thus, material and earthy though
he was. And so Alan the Rorka, and Chlorie his
wife were crowned, and occupied joint thrones in the
land of Keemar.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their joy in their unity, in the completeness of their
life, was a constant wonder to them. They renewed
their joys in their children—their life was almost
perfect. Sir John was growing feeble. Part of the
time he spent with Mavis and Desmond, and part with
Alan. But wherever he went, Masters and Zyllia
always accompanied him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mavis’ three children and Alan’s two, grew up like
brothers and sisters; indeed, their parents were all like
one big family. Alan had not long been on the throne
of Keemar, when an urgent message was brought him,
that Waz-Mula, humbly begged an audience.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who is he?” asked Alan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is holder of the key to the Hall of Sorrows,”
answered Y-Kjesta, “and sails the air bird, that plys
to and fro from Fyjipo.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I remember him well. Bring him in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“O noble Rorka, I beg a favour of you,” said Mula.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it that troubles you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You remember Arrack the Miserable?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has done a most noble thing, O Rorka. A
most terrible scourge has come upon the Hall of
Sorrows. A fire broke out. How or where it started
no one can tell, but when I reached the place, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>a raging furnace, and the poor captives were beating
against the gates in their frenzy to get out. The heat
was intense—their skins were blistering. I landed
safely, and rushed to undo the gates. But even as I
did so, great tongues of fire curled out and licked
round me. See, O Rorka, my hands are burnt—my
hair is scorched. Three times I essayed to unlock the
padlock, but the flames drove me back. Suddenly I
heard a cry, and Arrack burst through the flames.
‘Throw me the keys,’ he cried, and his tone
commanded and I obeyed. I watched him as he
touched the red hot metal—the flames were fiercer than
before. He never trembled or grew hasty. Although
his clothes were in flames, and the flesh burnt from his
fingers, yet still he strove to open the prison door.
At length he succeeded. Five figures fell out on to
the ground, burnt and still. I called to Arrack to save
himself, but his only answer was to beat his way
through the avenue of fire. Minutes passed and he
did not return. We looked at the poor burnt things
at our feet—their souls had departed, but as we looked
their mutilated bodies disappeared. Then through
the smoke and grime Arrack appeared bearing in his
arms a burden which he laid at my feet. He returned
again and again, and yet again. Five women’s lives
he saved, and he returned again to save the life of a
pet animal. Then, O Rorka, he fell at my feet. His
face was burnt beyond recognition; his poor hands
useless; his body one mass of blisters. He, and those
he saved we brought to Hoormoori. The women are
now in safety, but Arrack says his call has come. Oh,
my Rorka, this then is my prayer. His one wish now,
is to enter into glory through the Sacrament of
Schlerik-itata. Will you grant him pardon, and answer
his prayer?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Alan was much moved. “Go, return to Arrack.
Tell him Misrath shall come and administer the
Sacrament himself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“May I say that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“On board the air bird. He is in great pain, but
I think I could get him taken to the Temple in safety.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“See to it at once, my Waz.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hurriedly Alan sent for Misrath, and told him the
news.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He has purged his sins indeed,” said he.</p>

<p class='c012'>So, with the rites of Schlerik-itata, Arrack left
Keemar. He bent and kissed the hem of Alan’s
garment, and sank back exhausted in his chair. And
as the incense covered him, his voice could be heard
murmuring—“Great White Glory, I come—I
come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so there is to be no more Hall of Sorrows,”
said Chlorie softly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s gone for ever?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. It has served its purpose, but I don’t think
its omission will bring more sin into Keemar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe you are right, Alan. It was a terrible
place, and sometimes I think the punishment was too
great for the sin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A blue-eyed curly-haired girl ran into the room.
Breathless and flushed, she clasped a doll in her arms,
and hugged a pink-cheeked apple. She was followed
by a bright, eager-faced boy of twelve or thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, John Alan, I won’t marry you,” said she. “I
am Acuci, and Ipso-Rorka, and you are only Ak.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The children did not see the grown ups who were
hidden by a curtain, and their childish chatter went on
unheeded.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must marry me, Acuci—I love you, and papa
says that love is everything.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The little maid pouted. “I love you, John Alan,
and I think I’ll marry you after all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The two children embraced fondly, and ran out of
the room hand in hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My wife,” said Alan. “Don’t ever leave me.
Teach me to know the real meaning of Schlerik-itata—teach
me to believe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Chlorie offered her beautiful lips to her husband.
“Love teaches everything, my husband. Love is
powerful—love is mighty. Love will teach you even
that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He strained her to his breast. “My wife—my wife—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>love you so. The terror of parting is always with
me. Teach me to believe—you see, dear, even in this
Perfect World, there is a grain of sadness—of earthly
discontent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My husband—I have no fear—listen—.” And
from outside came the merry laughing voices of their
children at play. “In your children you will learn
belief.”</p>

<h4 class='c020'><i>Envoi</i></h4>

<p class='c021'>The time came when Sir John himself heard the
Call. Half believing, half fearing, he bade farewell.
The prayers were said, the incense rose about him,
and he, like the Jovians themselves, was taken to the
Great White Glory and was seen no more. And in
that moment, Alan believed and was content.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My wife,” he cried, “no longer is there any sadness
in my life. I believe. Jovians we have become
in body and in soul, I no longer fear—death.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And hand in hand they sat, married lovers ever, and
watched their children at play.</p>
